        "chapter_id": "3867",
        "explanation": "The conflicts in Chapter 3867 and Chapter 3885 reflect larger social problems because personal struggles there are caused by wider forces—power imbalances, class tensions, and institutional pressures—that shape characters’ options. By tracing how these external pressures force characters into difficult choices, the chapters turn individual dilemmas into symbols of broader societal struggles. This connection explains why the conflicts highlight the narrative’s social themes.",
        "correct_answer": "They mirror societal struggles, highlighting character dilemmas."

        "chapter_id": "3867",
        "explanation": "Explanation: The setting provides the social, physical, and historical context that creates pressures, opportunities, and constraints, which push characters toward certain choices and reactions. Those choices and reactions—shaped by local conditions and events in Chapters 3867 and 3873—drive changes in beliefs, skills, or relationships, forming their growth trajectories.",
        "correct_answer": "The setting influences characters' decisions and growth trajectories."

        "chapter_id": "3867",
        "explanation": "They are correct because those twists bring sudden, unforeseen obstacles that complicate characters’ goals and raise the stakes. By changing expectations and introducing new risks or information, the twists create uncertainty about outcomes and delay resolution. This forces characters into difficult choices and keeps readers tense and engaged.",
        "correct_answer": "They introduce unexpected challenges that heighten suspense."
