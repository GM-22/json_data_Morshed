        "question": "What contrasting perspectives on ambition are presented in Chapters 3873 and 3880, and how do they influence the plot's direction?",
        "chapter_id": "3873",
        "explanation": "The two chapters show ambition in opposite lights: Chapter 3873 presents ambition as a constructive or principled drive, while Chapter 3880 shows it as selfish, power-hungry, or destructive. These opposing motives push characters onto different courses of action, creating disagreements, broken alliances, and confrontations. Those conflicts become key turning points that steer the plot into new directions and raise the story’s tension.",
        "correct_answer": "Different ambitions lead to divergent paths causing tension."
