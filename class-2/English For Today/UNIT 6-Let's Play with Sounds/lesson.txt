        "question": "How do the moral dilemmas faced in Chapter 3880 compare to those in Chapter 3885, and what do they reveal about the characters?",
        "chapter_id": "3880",
        "explanation": "Both dilemmas force characters to choose between competing goods or duties, so the choices they make directly reveal their priorities and ethical limits. Moral conflicts expose whether a character values loyalty, honesty, self‑preservation, or the greater good, and where they will compromise or stand firm. Thus Chapter 3880 and Chapter 3885 both show characters’ core values and the boundaries of their morality, even if each dilemma tests a different aspect (e.g., personal sacrifice versus rule‑breaking).",
        "correct_answer": "Both dilemmas reveal characters' values and ethical boundaries."
