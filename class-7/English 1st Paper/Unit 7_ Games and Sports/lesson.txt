        "solution": "Solution:\nAnswer approach — locate the statement in the text that links sea-level rise to human impacts and extract the quantified consequence.\n\nWorking steps and reasoning:\n1. Identify cause and effect in the text: the cause is rising sea levels; the effect concerns human displacement in Bangladesh.\n2. Interpret the mechanisms: rising sea levels lead to increased coastal flooding, permanent inundation of low-lying areas, and salinization of land and water supplies. These processes destroy or render homes uninhabitable and undermine livelihoods.\n3. Extract the quantified consequence given in the text: the text states that as a result of these impacts, 3.5 million people may become homeless.\n4. Conclude logically: therefore, the direct consequence of rising sea levels in Bangladesh (as stated) is that 3.5 million people may lose their homes and become homeless.\n\nRelevant concepts:\n- Sea-level rise → coastal inundation and erosion\n- Vulnerability of low-lying deltaic regions (like Bangladesh)\n- Human displacement as a social consequence of environmental change\n\nFinal answer: 3.5 million people may become homeless.",
        "explanation": "Rising sea levels will flood and erode low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh, destroying homes and land, so about 3.5 million people may become homeless.

        "question": "Which of the following is a suggested action to combat climate change?",
        "solution": "Solution:\nAnswer: Use energy-saving bulbs.\n\nAnswer approach:\n- Identify the action and explain how it reduces climate change drivers (greenhouse gas emissions) through energy efficiency.\n\nEssential steps and reasoning:\n1. Energy-saving bulbs (LEDs or CFLs) use less electrical power to produce the same light compared with incandescent bulbs. Lower electricity use means less fuel burned at power plants, so fewer greenhouse gas emissions.\n2. Efficiency principle: reducing energy consumption for the same service reduces total emissions proportional to the electricity saved and the grid’s emission factor.\n3. Additional benefits: longer lifetime (fewer replacements → less manufacturing and waste) and lower household electricity bills.\n\nIllustrative example (compact):\n- Replacing a [math]60\\text{ W}[/math] incandescent with a [math]10\\text{ W}[/math] LED saves [math]60-10=50\\text{ W}[/math] or [math]0.05\\text{ kW}[/math].\n- If the bulb is used [math]5[/math] hours/day, daily energy saved is [math]0.05\\times5=0.25\\text{ kWh}[/math]; yearly that is about [math]0.25\\times365\\approx91.25\\text{ kWh}[/math].\n- With a grid emission factor of [math]0.5\\text{ kg CO}_2/\\text{kWh}[/math], annual CO2 avoided ≈ [math]91.25\\times0.5\\approx45.6\\text{ kg CO}_2[/math].\n\nConclusion:\nUsing energy-saving bulbs is a practical, cost-effective action that reduces electricity demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions, making it a recommended measure to help combat climate change.",
        "explanation": "Using energy-saving bulbs (like LEDs) reduces electricity use, which lowers carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Because less energy is needed, fewer fossil fuels are burned, so switching to these bulbs is a simple, effective way to help combat climate change.",

        "solution": "Solution:\nAnswer approach:\nIdentify the direct statement from the text about a major impact and explain briefly why that impact follows from climate change.\n\nSteps and reasoning:\n1. Key statement: The text mentions that one major impact is that seasons are shifting.\n2. Relevant concept: Climate change (global warming and altered atmospheric patterns) changes average temperatures and the timing of seasonal cues (temperature, day length interactions, precipitation).\n3. Logical link: As global temperatures rise and weather patterns change, the onset and length of seasons (for example, spring arriving earlier or winters becoming shorter/milder) shift in time and intensity. This is a direct consequence of sustained changes in climate variables.\n4. Consequences (brief): Shifted seasons affect ecosystems (plants bloom earlier, animal migrations change), agriculture (planting/harvest schedules), and human activities that depend on predictable seasonal timing.\n\nExample (illustrative):\n- Many regions now observe earlier spring blooming of flowers and trees, which demonstrates how seasons are occurring at different times than historically expected.\n\nFinal answer:\nOne of the major impacts of climate change mentioned in the text is that seasons are shifting.",
        "explanation": "Seasons are shifting is correct because rising global temperatures change the timing and intensity of seasonal patterns, so events like spring flowering, animal migrations, and the onset of winter occur earlier or later than before.
