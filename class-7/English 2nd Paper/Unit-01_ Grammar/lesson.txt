        "solution": "a. An educated mother plays the key role in building up an educated nation.b. A child is always in touch with its mother.c. If the mother is educated, her children will be educated.d. An educated nation should be indebted to its educated mothers.e. So, all mothers should be educated.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: Form each sentence by picking one phrase from the first column (subject), one from the second (verb or auxiliary), and one from the third (object/complement) so you produce a complete subject–verb–complement structure. Ensure grammatical agreement and logical sense (for example, \"An educated mother\" + \"plays\" + \"the key role in building up an educated nation\" or \"If the mother\" + \"should\" + \"be educated, her children will be educated\"), and adjust punctuation or helpers (like adding \"if\" or \"are\") when needed. This way you can make five correct sentences by combining different items while keeping meaning and grammar correct.",
