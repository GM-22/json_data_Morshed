        "explanation": "The correct version capitalizes the first word of each sentence and the pronoun \"I\", and uses commas, periods, quotation marks, and an apostrophe to separate speakers and end statements so the meaning is clear. Proper punctuation breaks the run-on text into distinct spoken lines and clauses (for example, commas after \"said\", periods to end sentences, and \"I'm\" with an apostrophe), which shows who is speaking and what each person means.",
