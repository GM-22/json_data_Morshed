        "question": "Change the narrative style of the following sentences.\n\n(a) I said to the man, “Do you know anybody here?”\n\n(b) Maruf said, “Let us go for a picnic.”\n\n(c) She said, “Let him do it again.”\n\n(d) Father said to me, “Don’t tell a lie.”\n\n(e) The teacher said to us, “Make good use of your time.”",
        "solution": "(a) I asked the man if he knew anybody there.\n\n(b) Maruf proposed that we should go for a picnic.\n\n(c) She suggested that he should do it again.\n\n(d) Father advised me not to tell a lie.\n\n(e) The teacher advised us to make good use of our time.",
        "explanation": "(a) \"Said to\" becomes \"asked\" as it’s a question, and \"Do you know\" changes to \"if he knew\"; \"here\" becomes \"there\".\n\n(b) \"Let us\" implies a suggestion; so \"proposed\" is used followed by \"that we should go\".\n\n(c) \"Let him\" suggests permission or suggestion; thus we use \"suggested that he should\".\n\n(d) Negative command changes \"said to\" to \"advised\", and \"Don’t tell\" becomes \"not to tell\".\n\n(e) An imperative statement; we convert \"said to\" into \"advised\", and the rest into infinitive form.",
