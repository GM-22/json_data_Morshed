        "explanation": "A correct 250-word composition on \"Discipline\" is right because it clearly defines the term and explains its importance in personal, academic, and social life, giving readers a focused central idea. It helps students understand the concept by using one or two concrete examples or practices (like time management, habit formation) and by showing the benefits of discipline through outcomes such as success, reliability, and self-control. Structurally, a brief introduction, two or three body paragraphs with examples, and a concise conclusion keep the essay coherent and complete within the word limit.",

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Value of Time}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Time is the most valuable thing in our life. It is more precious than money, gold, or anything else. Once time is gone, it never returns. So, we must value every second and use time wisely.[math]\\textbf{Importance in Life:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Everything in the world follows time. The sun rises and sets on time. Trains and planes run according to schedule. If we do not use time properly, we fall behind in life. Time helps us become successful and respected.[math]\\textbf{Time for Students:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Student life is the best time to build a future. Those who study regularly, follow routine, and do everything on time become good students. Laziness and delay bring failure and sadness. So, students should make good use of their time.[math]\\textbf{Famous Quotes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E There is a saying — “Time and tide wait for none.” This teaches us that we must not waste time. Another saying is — “Work while you work, play while you play.” This tells us that everything has a proper time.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Time is like a sword — if we do not cut with it, it will cut us. Success and happiness depend on proper use of time. So, we should always be punctual, organized, and never waste time.",
        "explanation": "Time is a priceless resource because it is limited and irreversible. Every person, rich or poor, gets the same 24 hours, and once a moment passes it cannot be recovered; recognizing this truth makes us careful about how we spend our days. Using time wisely means setting clear priorities—focusing first on tasks that matter most for learning, work, health, and relationships—so effort produces real progress rather than mere busyness.\n\nGood time management begins with planning: making realistic schedules, breaking big goals into small steps, and avoiding procrastination. Simple habits like waking up early, limiting distractions (for example social media), and allocating specific time blocks for study or practice turn intentions into results. Consistency is more powerful than occasional effort; steady daily work compounds into skill, knowledge, and opportunities over months and years.\n\nWasting time leads to missed chances, stress, and regret. When we delay important tasks, problems pile up and quality suffers. In contrast, valuing time brings discipline, reduces anxiety, and builds confidence because tasks are completed and goals are met. Time also teaches respect for others—being punctual shows consideration and strengthens trust.\n\nUltimately, treating time as valuable helps us live a purposeful life. It encourages us to invest in things that matter—education, health, relationships, and honest work—so that when we look back, we see a life shaped by thoughtful choices rather than by avoidable losses.",

Many girls face early marriage, domestic violence, and lack of safety. In rural areas, women often have less freedom. Social customs and lack of education make it hard for them to grow.[math]\\textbf{How to Empower:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Education is key. Educated women become confident and independent.

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{A Rainy Day}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E A rainy day is a day when the sky remains cloudy and it rains continuously or off and on. In Bangladesh, rainy days are very common during the monsoon. Though some people find it uncomfortable, a rainy day is a source of beauty and emotion for many.[math]\\textbf{Nature’s Look:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E On a rainy day, the whole sky remains overcast with clouds. The rain falls gently or heavily, depending on the weather. Trees and plants look fresh and green. Roads become muddy and slippery. Rivers, ponds, and canals overflow with water. Birds take shelter in trees, and the whole environment looks quiet and calm.[math]\\textbf{Effect on Life:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E For office goers and students, a rainy day can be troublesome. People get wet, buses run late, and traffic jams become worse. Schools sometimes remain closed. But for children and villagers, a rainy day brings fun. Children play in the rain and make paper boats. Farmers become happy as rain helps in cultivation.[math]\\textbf{Food and Mood:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Many people enjoy hot tea, khichuri, eggs, and fried food on a rainy day. The sound of rain falling on tin roofs creates a peaceful feeling. Writers and poets often get inspiration on rainy days.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E A rainy day is a part of nature’s beauty. Though it creates some problems, it also brings joy, peace, and refreshment. It teaches us to pause and enjoy the simple moments of life.",
        "explanation": "Rain began as a hesitant whisper, then gathered courage to drum steadily on the roof, turning the ordinary afternoon into a soft symphony. Windows blurred with streaks of silver as droplets chased each other down the glass; the garden inhaled the scent of wet earth and exhaled fresh, green promises. Children pressed faces against panes, eyes wide with the small, private thrill of suspended play, while umbrellas bloomed like colorful mushrooms along the street. Puddles became maps for small boats and toy sailors, reflections of neon signs and gray clouds mingling in miniature lakes. The city, usually sharp with hurry, slowed its breath; footsteps splashed in rhythm and conversations softened beneath the patter. Inside, a kettle hissed and steam wrote quick, warm letters on the cool air, while someone reached for an old book whose pages smelled of attic summers and forgotten winters. The rain smoothed the day’s edges, reconciling hurried plans with the gentle permission to pause. Lovers walked closer under shared canopies, their laughter muffled but brighter against the gray. Farther away, a farmer welcomed the softened soil like a relieved friend, and rooftop gardens drank greedily, leaves glistening like polished coins. Nightfall dimmed the rain to a lullaby, and the lamps reflected in wet streets seemed like lanterns guiding thoughts inward. In that steady, patient downpour, the world felt both cleansed and quietly celebrated, as if the sky were washing corners of the day to prepare them for a softer, clearer tomorrow. Everyone slept with peaceful smiles.\n\nThis composition works because it uses sensory details—sound, sight, smell—and concrete images to create a vivid rainy-day atmosphere. The structure moves from outside scenes to indoor moments and back, giving a complete, relatable picture that helps readers feel the mood and purpose of the rain.",

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Anti-discrimination Student Movement}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was one of the biggest student-led protests in Bangladesh in recent times. It happened in July 2024 and started because students were unhappy about the unfair job quota system announced by the government.[math]\\textbf{The Cause of Protest:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E In June 2024, the High Court of Bangladesh declared a 30% quota for children of freedom fighters in government jobs. However, there were already quotas for other groups. As a result, only 44% of jobs remained open for general applicants. Students believed this system was unjust and demanded a fair distribution of opportunities.[math]\\textbf{Historical Background:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E This protest was not new. Students had previously protested against quota systems in 2013 and 2018. Those movements created awareness, but in 2024, the issue became more serious and widespread.[math]\\textbf{Nature of the Protest:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Students across the country took to the streets. They blocked major roads and organized sit-ins. On July 15, the protest turned violent when armed individuals attacked students. Many were injured. Yet, the protests grew stronger. Social media helped spread the movement quickly.[math]\\textbf{Demand and Result:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E On August 3, students declared that the government must resign. Their demand was bold, but it showed their frustration. They wanted fairness, not privilege based on birth. The protest was about equality, merit, and justice.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was a powerful example of student unity and courage. It reminded the nation that youth will rise against injustice. The movement has made a permanent mark on Bangladesh’s political and social history.",
        "explanation": "This explanation is correct because it shows that a good 250-word composition on the Anti-discrimination Student Movement should define the movement, explain its causes and objectives, describe concrete student actions and outcomes, and end with a clear call to action—covering the essential parts readers expect.

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Child Labour in Bangladesh}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Child labour is a serious social and economic problem in Bangladesh. It means engaging children in jobs that are harmful to their physical and mental growth. Millions of children in our country work in factories, hotels, shops, and households to support their families.[math]\\textbf{Causes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The main causes of child labour are poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and lack of awareness. Many parents are so poor that they send their children to work instead of sending them to school. Employers prefer children because they can be paid less and forced to work long hours.[math]\\textbf{Types of Work:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Child labourers in Bangladesh work in garment factories, brickfields, tea stalls, and as domestic workers. Some even work in dangerous places like chemical industries and construction sites. They often face abuse, low wages, and health problems.[math]\\textbf{Effects:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Child labour deprives children of education and a proper childhood. It keeps them in a cycle of poverty. They grow up with poor health, lack of skills, and low self-esteem. This creates an unskilled and weak future generation for the country.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The government must enforce child labour laws strictly. Free and compulsory education must be ensured. Parents must be given support and jobs so that they don’t need to send their children to work.

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Corruption in Society}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Corruption is a serious disease in society. It means dishonest or illegal behavior, especially by powerful people like government officials, politicians, or businessmen. Corruption destroys the development of a nation, creates injustice, and spreads inequality.[math]\\textbf{Forms of Corruption:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Bribery, nepotism, tax evasion, misuse of public funds, and cheating are common types of corruption. In many cases, people have to pay extra money to get jobs, licenses, or services that should be free or fair. It also happens in courts, police, hospitals, and schools.[math]\\textbf{Causes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The main causes of corruption are greed, lack of transparency, weak law enforcement, political influence, and poverty. When people see that corrupt people are not punished, they lose faith in justice and become corrupt themselves.[math]\\textbf{Effects on Society:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Corruption makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. It stops good people from getting opportunities. Roads, schools, and hospitals remain poor in quality because of fund theft. It leads to frustration, crime, and public anger. The whole society suffers.[math]\\textbf{Ways to Stop Corruption:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Strong laws and punishments are needed. Digital systems and automation can reduce human contact and corruption. People must be educated to be honest. Media and civil society should raise their voice. Whistleblowers must be protected.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Corruption is a curse that destroys both individuals and nations. If we want a just and developed country, we must fight against corruption together. Honesty should be taught at home and school.",

It is one of the biggest threats to nature and human survival. In Bangladesh, forests are disappearing rapidly due to overpopulation, urbanization, and industrial needs.[math]\\textbf{Causes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E People cut trees for fuel, farming, furniture, and construction. Forests are cleared for roads, buildings, and factories. Illegal logging and forest fires also cause destruction. Many don’t realize the long-term effects.[math]\\textbf{Effects:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Deforestation leads to soil erosion, loss of wildlife, and climate change. It reduces rainfall and increases temperature. Rivers dry up, and natural disasters like floods and droughts become common. Animals lose their homes, and biodiversity is damaged. It also affects air quality and health.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E We must plant trees regularly. Deforested lands should be reforested. Alternative fuels should be used to reduce tree cutting. Forest laws must be enforced strictly. People should be educated on the value of trees.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Trees are our natural friends. If forests die, life on Earth will become impossible. We must protect forests for ourselves and future generations. Deforestation must stop now.",

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Early Marriage: Causes and Prevention}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Early marriage means getting married before reaching legal age. In Bangladesh, the legal age is 18 for girls and 21 for boys. But many children, especially girls, are forced into marriage at 14 or even younger. Early marriage is a violation of human rights and causes long-term damage to society.[math]\\textbf{Causes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Poverty is a major cause. Poor families think marrying off daughters reduces financial burden. Lack of education is another reason. In many villages, people believe girls should marry early to maintain family honor. Fear of harassment or insecurity also leads to early marriage. Some parents are unaware of the legal and health risks.[math]\\textbf{Negative Effects:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Early marriage ends a child’s education and future dreams. Child brides face health risks like early pregnancy and childbirth complications. Many suffer from malnutrition, depression, and domestic abuse. Their children also suffer from poor care and education. The cycle of poverty continues.[math]\\textbf{How to Prevent:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Education is the best way to stop early marriage. If girls stay in school, they marry later and live better lives. Parents need awareness programs. Religious leaders and local authorities should speak against child marriage. The law must be enforced strictly, and violators must be punished.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Early marriage is harmful for individuals and the nation. It kills dreams, health, and opportunities. We must fight early marriage with education, awareness, and strict law. Let every child grow freely and safely.",

Its geographical position, numerous rivers, and monsoon climate make it vulnerable to frequent floods. Although floods are natural, their impact on people and the economy can be devastating.[math]\\textbf{Causes of Flood:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Heavy rainfall during the monsoon is the main cause of floods. Overflowing of rivers like Padma, Jamuna, and Brahmaputra submerges vast areas. Melting of Himalayan glaciers increases river water levels. Poor drainage in urban areas and deforestation make floods worse.[math]\\textbf{Effects of Floods:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Floods damage crops, houses, roads, schools, and hospitals. Many people become homeless and have to take shelter in flood centers. Food and drinking water become scarce. Diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and skin infections spread easily. Educational activities are interrupted for weeks.[math]\\textbf{Impact on Economy and Society:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Farmers suffer the most because their crops are washed away. Transportation stops, and business activities decline. Relief work becomes expensive and often delays. The country’s GDP is affected by repeated flood losses.[math]\\textbf{Relief and Response:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The government and NGOs try to provide relief by supplying food, clean water, medicine, and shelter. Volunteers and local people also help flood victims. Boats and helicopters are used for rescue. Early warning systems are improving, but much more needs to be done.[math]\\textbf{Prevention and }[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Building embankments, dredging rivers, planting trees, and improving drainage can reduce flood damage. Public awareness and community training are essential. Scientific forecasting systems must be upgraded.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E We cannot stop floods, but we can reduce their damage.

Children suffer from poor growth, and pregnant women face complications. Long-term consumption damages the body silently.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The government must take strict action.

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Gender Equality in Education}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Gender equality in education means giving boys and girls equal rights and opportunities to study, grow, and succeed. In many parts of the world, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh, girls have historically faced more challenges in accessing education. But without gender equality, true development is not possible.[math]\\textbf{Why It Matters:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E When girls are educated, they become healthier, economically stronger, and more confident. They can support their families, raise better-educated children, and take leadership roles in society. Boys and girls must be treated equally in schools, colleges, and society. Education is a right, not a privilege based on gender.[math]\\textbf{Current Situation in Bangladesh:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E In recent years, Bangladesh has made progress. Girls now outnumber boys in many schools. Government programs like stipends and free books have helped improve girls’ attendance. Female teachers are encouraged, and awareness is rising. However, in rural areas, early marriage, poverty, and family restrictions still prevent many girls from continuing their education.[math]\\textbf{Challenges:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Girls often face harassment on the way to school, lack of toilets, and unsafe environments. Some families still believe that girls do not need higher education. These social attitudes must change.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E More schools should be built closer to homes. Safety must be ensured. Parents need awareness. Laws against early marriage and gender discrimination should be strictly enforced. Both boys and girls should learn to respect each other.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Gender equality in education is essential for a fair, successful, and developed society. Let us ensure every child, regardless of gender, gets equal chance to learn and lead.",
        "explanation": "Gender equality in education means that girls and boys have the same opportunities to learn, participate, and succeed at every level of schooling. Ensuring equality requires removing social, economic, and cultural barriers that disproportionately affect girls, such as child marriage, poverty, and discriminatory attitudes. When both sexes receive quality education, societies gain economically through higher productivity, improved health outcomes, and greater civic participation. Educated girls are more likely to delay marriage, have healthier children, and contribute to household income, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits communities.\n\nSchools must be safe, inclusive, and responsive: curricula should avoid gender stereotypes, teachers should receive training on gender-sensitive pedagogy, and facilities must meet the needs of all learners, including separate sanitation for girls. Policies like scholarship programs, conditional cash transfers, and community awareness campaigns can increase enrollment and retention. Data collection disaggregated by gender helps target interventions and monitor progress.\n\nAddressing gender equality also means supporting boys where they face disadvantages and recognizing intersecting inequalities related to disability, ethnicity, and poverty. Collaboration among governments, local communities, families, and international partners is essential to create sustained change. Achieving gender equality in education is not only a matter of fairness but a strategic investment in a country's development and resilience.

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Global Warming and Climate Change}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Global warming and climate change are two of the most serious environmental issues in today’s world. Global warming refers to the rise in Earth’s average temperature due to the increase of greenhouse gases. Climate change includes global warming and its broader effects like droughts, floods, and sea-level rise.[math]\\textbf{Causes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Burning fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil), deforestation, and industrial emissions are the major causes of global warming. These activities release carbon dioxide, methane, and other harmful gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Cutting down trees reduces the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide.[math]\\textbf{Effects:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The Earth is getting hotter every year. Polar ice is melting, causing sea levels to rise. This leads to flooding in coastal areas. There are more droughts, heatwaves, and storms. Agriculture is being affected, and many species are becoming extinct. Bangladesh, being a low-lying country, is at high risk.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E We must reduce carbon emissions by using renewable energy like solar and wind power. Planting more trees, reducing plastic use, and recycling can help. Governments must take global steps, like following the Paris Agreement. People must also be aware and make eco-friendly choices.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Global warming is a threat to life on Earth. We must act now before it is too late. Protecting the environment is not only the duty of the government but also of every citizen.",
        "explanation": "The composition is correct because it clearly defines global warming and climate change, links them to increased greenhouse gases from human activities, and describes key impacts and practical solutions in a balanced way.

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Load Shedding}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Load shedding means the temporary stopping of electricity in different areas. It is a common problem in Bangladesh, especially during the summer. It creates serious problems in homes, schools, offices, and hospitals.[math]\\textbf{Causes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The main cause is the shortage of electricity production. Other causes include misuse of electricity, old equipment, and poor management. When demand is more than supply, the authority cuts off power to manage the load.[math]\\textbf{Effects:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Students cannot study properly. Business and industries face losses. Hospitals suffer during emergency treatments. Food gets spoiled. People sweat in the heat without fans or ACs. Internet and mobile networks also stop working.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E We should use electricity wisely. Government should invest in solar and wind power. Corruption and theft in the power sector must stop. Awareness programs can help people save power.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Load shedding is harmful for national progress. Everyone should help save electricity. Only then can we enjoy an uninterrupted life.",
        "explanation": "Load shedding refers to the planned, temporary interruption of electrical power supply to certain areas to prevent a total collapse of the power grid when demand exceeds available generation. It is typically used as an emergency measure when generation capacity, fuel supply, transmission constraints, or maintenance shortfalls make it impossible to meet peak demand. The immediate effects are widespread: households lose lighting and refrigeration, businesses halt production, schools and hospitals face disruptions, and public safety can be compromised. Repeated outages erode productivity, increase costs for businesses (through lost work and damaged equipment), and reduce the quality of life for residents.\n\nRoot causes include inadequate generation capacity, aging infrastructure, fuel shortages, poor maintenance, financial problems in power utilities, and weak grid management. Short-term coping strategies include scheduled outage notices, rotating supply to distribute inconvenience, backup generators, and community cooling/storage centers. Long-term solutions focus on increasing and diversifying supply (building new plants, investing in renewables like solar and wind), improving grid infrastructure and maintenance, strengthening transmission lines, implementing demand-side management (energy efficiency, time-of-use tariffs, smart meters), and reforming utility finances and governance to ensure reliable fuel procurement and investment.\n\nEffective policies combine technical upgrades with realistic planning and public communication so outages are minimized and better managed. Encouraging rooftop solar, battery storage, and microgrids can reduce peak pressure on the central grid and provide resilience for critical services. Ultimately, ending chronic load shedding requires sustained investment, transparent management, and coordinated energy policy that balances supply expansion with smarter demand management.",

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Unemployment Problem in Bangladesh}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Unemployment means the condition of people who are willing to work but cannot find jobs. It is one of the major socio-economic problems in Bangladesh. Despite having a large population, the country cannot provide enough employment for its citizens.[math]\\textbf{Causes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The main causes are overpopulation, lack of proper education, limited industries, and poor planning. Many students graduate with degrees that do not match market needs. Rural-urban migration also increases pressure on city jobs. Corruption and nepotism in recruitment worsen the problem.[math]\\textbf{Types:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E There are several types of unemployment — educated unemployment, seasonal unemployment, and disguised unemployment (where more people work than needed). Many young graduates remain jobless for years.[math]\\textbf{Effects:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Unemployment causes frustration, depression, and sometimes crime. It increases poverty and weakens the economy. Skilled people leave the country, leading to brain drain. Families suffer from poor living standards.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Technical education and vocational training should be encouraged. New industries and small businesses must be supported. The government should offer loans and incentives to young entrepreneurs. Corruption in job sectors must be stopped.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Unemployment is a threat to development. A nation cannot grow with unemployed youth. Creating job opportunities must be our top priority.",

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Population Problem in Bangladesh}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. With over 170 million people living in a small area, the country is facing serious population-related challenges. This problem affects almost every aspect of life — from food and housing to education and employment.[math]\\textbf{Reasons for Overpopulation:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Lack of awareness about family planning, early marriage, poverty, and low literacy rates are the main reasons for overpopulation. In rural areas, people often think more children mean more help in work. Many families are unaware of the economic and social burden caused by large families.[math]\\textbf{Effects of Overpopulation:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Overpopulation creates a huge strain on food, water, land, education, and healthcare. Schools become overcrowded, and hospitals cannot treat all patients properly. Unemployment rises, and crime rates increase. Urban areas suffer from traffic jams, pollution, and housing crises.[math]\\textbf{Impact on Development:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Rapid population growth makes it difficult to provide quality education and job opportunities. It slows down economic progress. Resources that could be used for development are instead spent on basic needs like food and shelter. Government services become insufficient.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The only way to solve this problem is through strong family planning programs, public awareness campaigns, and compulsory education for girls. Delaying marriage and promoting one or two-child families can help control growth. Religious leaders, teachers, and media can also spread awareness.[math]\\textbf{Government Role:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The government should ensure availability of free birth control services, provide incentives for small families, and punish false registration or misuse of welfare schemes.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Population is both a strength and a challenge. If managed well, it can become a national asset. But if it continues to grow unchecked, it can destroy progress. We must act now to save our future.",

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{Price Hike in Bangladesh}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Price hike means the continuous rise in the prices of daily necessities. In recent years, it has become a major problem in Bangladesh. It affects every class of people, especially the poor and middle-income families. The rising prices of food, fuel, and transportation are making life harder day by day.[math]\\textbf{Causes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E There are many reasons behind price hike. Some of them are natural disasters like floods or droughts that damage crops. Others include hoarding by dishonest traders, increased fuel prices, import taxes, transportation costs, and global market changes. Political instability and corruption also add to the problem.[math]\\textbf{Effects:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Price hike creates great suffering. Poor people cannot afford proper food or medicine. Many families are forced to reduce meals or borrow money. Students drop out of school because of financial pressure. Crimes like theft and cheating increase when people become desperate.[math]\\textbf{Impact on Society:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Price hike increases inequality. The rich get richer, but the poor get poorer. The middle class is disappearing. Social unrest, frustration, and protests become more common. It also damages trust in markets and government policies.[math]\\textbf{Solutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The government must monitor markets regularly. Hoarders and corrupt traders should be punished. Subsidies should be given on food, medicine, and fuel. Encouraging local production and reducing dependency on imports will help stabilize prices.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Price hike is a threat to peace and development. It must be controlled with strong action, honest leadership, and public cooperation. Only then can people live with hope and dignity.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: The 250‑word composition is correct because it succinctly outlines the main causes of price hikes in Bangladesh (supply disruptions, inflation, currency depreciation), describes their social and economic effects (reduced purchasing power, food insecurity, strain on households), and proposes clear remedies (targeted subsidies, improved supply chains, prudent fiscal and monetary policies) in a logical order. This reflects the underlying concept of effective composition: address the topic directly, use relevant facts and local examples, and connect causes to consequences and solutions within the word limit. For students: plan a brief introduction, two focused paragraphs covering causes and effects with examples, and a concise conclusion offering solutions, using simple language and coherent linkage.",

It is clean, safe, and environmentally friendly. In the face of climate change and energy crisis, renewable energy is the only path to a sustainable and secure future.[math]\\textbf{Types of Renewable Energy:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The main types are solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass energy. These sources are naturally replenished and do not pollute the environment. Solar panels collect sunlight, wind turbines use wind, and dams produce electricity from flowing water.[math]\\textbf{Importance:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Fossil fuels like coal and oil are limited and harmful to the environment. They cause pollution, global warming, and health issues. Renewable energy reduces carbon emissions, slows down climate change, and keeps the air clean. It also creates green jobs and makes countries energy-independent.[math]\\textbf{Renewable Energy in Bangladesh:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Bangladesh has good potential for solar and wind energy. Many schools and homes in rural areas now use solar panels. The government is promoting “Green Energy” through different projects. Off-grid solar systems have brought electricity to remote villages.[math]\\textbf{Challenges:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E High initial costs, lack of technology, and lack of skilled manpower are the main barriers. People also lack awareness of the long-term benefits. More investment, training, and research are needed.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Renewable energy is not just a choice — it is a necessity. For a clean, healthy, and sustainable world, we must shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Every step toward green energy is a step toward saving the planet.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: Focusing a composition on renewable energy is correct because renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, biomass) produce little or no greenhouse gases, so they directly address climate change and air pollution while ensuring long-term energy supply.

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{The Impact of COVID-19 on Education}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of life across the world. One of the sectors hit hardest was education. Schools, colleges, and universities were closed for months. Students, teachers, and parents faced an entirely new way of learning. In Bangladesh, the impact was even more serious because of limited digital access.[math]\\textbf{Closure of Institutions:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Educational institutions were closed for over a year. Board exams were delayed or canceled. Millions of students lost connection with formal learning. Children in rural areas suffered the most due to lack of smartphones, internet, or even electricity.[math]\\textbf{Online Education:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E During the pandemic, online classes became the new normal. Platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and YouTube were used. However, not all students could attend regularly. Network issues, lack of devices, and poor digital literacy were common problems. Many students lost interest and motivation.[math]\\textbf{Mental Health and Social Impact:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Isolation from classmates, stress of online learning, and uncertainty about exams caused mental pressure. Many students fell into depression, anxiety, or laziness. Physical activities stopped, and social development was hampered.[math]\\textbf{Positive Outcomes:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Despite challenges, the crisis increased awareness of digital learning. Teachers and students learned new technologies. Educational apps and TV programs (like Sangsad TV in Bangladesh) reached some remote learners. It also showed the importance of internet and IT in education.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E COVID-19 showed us that education must be flexible and accessible to all. Digital tools must be developed, and students must be supported emotionally and technologically. Education must go on, no matter the situation.",
        "explanation": "COVID-19 transformed education worldwide, exposing both strengths and deep weaknesses in systems and accelerating long-term change. Prolonged school closures forced a rapid shift to remote learning, which highlighted the digital divide as many learners lacked devices, reliable internet, or a conducive home environment. Educators adapted by creating online lessons, using video conferencing, and adopting flexible assessment, yet disadvantaged students often experienced greater learning loss and reduced access to support services. The crisis also drove innovation: blended learning models, open educational resources, and low-tech approaches such as radio and SMS lessons were scaled to reach those without broadband. Higher education faced financial and enrollment pressures but expanded virtual instruction and reconsidered program delivery and student services. Social and emotional learning gained prominence as students and teachers coped with isolation, stress, and disrupted routines, prompting schools to strengthen mental health supports and community partnerships. Assessment practices shifted toward formative, competency-based methods that emphasize critical thinking over memorization. Policy responses varied; some governments invested in connectivity and devices, while others prioritized phased reopenings with health protocols. Long-term outcomes depend on recovery efforts: targeted tutoring, extended learning time, and data-driven monitoring can mitigate learning losses, but without equitable investments the pandemic risks widening existing inequalities. To build resilient education systems, stakeholders must invest in infrastructure, continuous teacher development, inclusive policies, and supports for vulnerable learners, while sharing best practices internationally to prepare for future crises.\n\nExplanation:\nThis composition is correct because it summarizes key impacts (access, pedagogy, equity, mental health, policy) and links immediate disruptions to long-term implications and remedies. It helps students understand the concept by showing cause (pandemic closures) and effect (remote learning, widened gaps), plus concrete responses needed to recover and strengthen education systems.",

They give us life and support the balance of nature. Without trees, we cannot survive. So tree plantation is not only necessary, it is a duty for all of us.[math]\\textbf{Benefits of Trees:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Trees provide oxygen, shade, and fruits. They absorb carbon dioxide and reduce air pollution. They stop soil erosion, bring rain, and keep the weather pleasant. Trees are home to many birds and animals.[math]\\textbf{Economic and Health Benefits:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Trees give us wood, medicine, and raw materials. They reduce stress, make our surroundings peaceful, and help us live longer. Parks and gardens with trees make cities more livable.[math]\\textbf{Condition in Bangladesh:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Our country needs more trees. According to experts, 25% of land should be forested, but we have much less. Deforestation is harming our environment.[math]\\textbf{Best Time and Awareness:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E The rainy season is the best time for planting trees. Schools, colleges, and government offices should organize tree plantation programs. People should be aware of its importance and join such efforts.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Tree plantation is a great act of service to nature and future generations. If every person plants and cares for at least one tree, we can make our world greener and better.",
        "explanation": "Tree plantation is a simple yet powerful activity that helps protect the environment and improves human life. Planting trees increases green cover, conserves soil, conserves water, and supports biodiversity. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change. Their roots prevent soil erosion, maintain groundwater levels, and provide shade that cools surrounding areas.\n\nBesides environmental benefits, trees support wildlife by offering habitat and food for birds, insects, and small animals. Fruit-bearing trees supply nutritious food and can boost local economies. Urban trees enhance the beauty of neighborhoods, increase property values, and improve mental well-being by creating peaceful green spaces. Community tree-planting projects foster social cohesion and teach children about nature and responsibility.\n\nSuccessful tree plantation requires choosing the right species for local climate and soil, proper planting techniques, and ongoing care. Dig a hole twice the width of the root ball, place the sapling upright, backfill with soil, and water thoroughly. Mulching conserves moisture and suppresses weeds, while staking protects young trees from wind. Regular watering during the first two years and protection from pests are essential for survival.\n\nGovernments, schools, NGOs, and individuals must collaborate to increase tree cover. Incentives like community nurseries, awareness campaigns, and legal protection for forests encourage participation. By planting and nurturing trees, we invest in a healthier, greener future for ourselves and coming generations. Each planted tree is a step toward cleaner air, stable climates, and richer biodiversity. Small efforts by many people create lasting change around the world.",

        "explanation": "A 250-word composition on \"The Role of Technology in Education\" is appropriate because it gives enough space to present core ideas—improved access to resources, increased engagement, personalized learning, and assessment tools—while remaining focused and coherent.

        "solution": "[math]\\textbf{The Rivers of Bangladesh}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E [math]\\textbf{Introduction:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Bangladesh is often referred to as the “Land of Rivers.” There are more than 700 rivers crisscrossing the country. These rivers are not only a gift of nature but also the foundation of the country's agriculture, transportation, trade, and culture.[math]\\textbf{Major Rivers:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Some of the major rivers are the Padma, Jamuna, Meghna, Brahmaputra, Teesta, Surma, and Karnaphuli. These rivers help in irrigation, fishing, and connecting remote villages to towns and cities. Rivers are also sacred in religion and celebrated in poems and songs.[math]\\textbf{Importance:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Rivers bring fertility to the land by depositing alluvial soil. They are vital for rice and jute farming, which are key agricultural products. People travel by boat through rivers. Fishermen catch hilsa and other fish, earning their livelihood. River ports like Narayanganj and Barisal play a role in national trade.[math]\\textbf{Cultural Significance:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Rivers are deeply rooted in Bengali literature and art. Famous poets like Rabindranath Tagore and Jasimuddin wrote beautiful verses inspired by river life. Boat races, festivals, and folk music often happen by the riverside.[math]\\textbf{Threats and Protection:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Unfortunately, many rivers are dying due to pollution, illegal grabbing, and overuse. Factories release toxic waste into rivers. Climate change is also affecting water flow. River protection laws and awareness campaigns are urgently needed.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Rivers are like the blood vessels of Bangladesh. To save our country, we must save our rivers. Proper care and use of rivers will ensure our future prosperity.",
        "explanation": "The composition is correct because it systematically describes the major rivers (Padma, Jamuna, Meghna), their origins and courses, seasonal behaviors (monsoon floods and erosion), and their economic and cultural importance, all organized into a clear introduction, body, and conclusion to meet the 250-word requirement. Understanding the underlying concept means recognizing that rivers shape Bangladesh’s geography, agriculture, transport, and daily life, so effective writing links physical facts with human effects and examples. To replicate this, students should use accurate facts, simple chronological or thematic structure, and a balanced focus on physical features and social importance.",

He works in fields, construction sites, factories, and markets. His life is full of struggle and uncertainty. Though his work is vital for society, his condition is often ignored.[math]\\textbf{Daily Life:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E A day labourer wakes up early in the morning and goes to the labor station or roadside to find work. Sometimes he gets hired; sometimes he returns home empty-handed. He works under the sun or in the rain. His work includes carrying bricks, digging, ploughing fields, or loading goods.[math]\\textbf{Living Condition:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Most day labourers live in slums or poor huts. They often do not have access to clean water, electricity, or proper sanitation. Their meals are simple — rice, lentils, or leftover food. They cannot afford good clothes, education for their children, or medical treatment.[math]\\textbf{Struggles:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E A day labourer’s income is low and irregular. When he falls sick, he loses work and income. During off-seasons, disasters, or lockdowns, their situation becomes worse. Even with honest work, they are often treated without respect by others.[math]\\textbf{Importance in Society:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E Despite all these struggles, day labourers play a vital role in the development of the country. Roads, buildings, and crops would not exist without their hard work. They are the real builders of the nation.[math]\\textbf{Conclusion:}[/math]\u003Cbr\u003E We must respect and support day labourers.

Everyone should read regularly and make books their true companions.",
        "explanation": "A good answer is correct because it states a clear main idea—that reading books enriches knowledge and develops the mind—and supports it with specific, relevant benefits such as improved vocabulary, critical thinking, imagination, and emotional understanding. It demonstrates the underlying concept by organizing points logically (introduction, supporting paragraphs with examples, and a conclusion) and using linking words to keep the flow coherent. By keeping language clear, giving concrete examples, and maintaining the required length and structure, the composition effectively communicates the importance of reading.",

Discipline means obedience to rules. It is necessary for success in life. It also means obedience to orderly conduct.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nEverything within the universe is conducted in discipline. Breach of discipline brings downfall. In the world nothing is above discipline. If every man does as he likes, then there will be chaos in the society. So, the importance of discipline is very great. We should follow discipline to be successful in the battle of life.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn the army discipline is essential. Everyone in the army has to lead a strictly disciplined life. If the soldiers do not obey orders, they become at once a mere rabble unfit to do their duty. A small group of military is more capable to control a mob of thousands than a large group of police. It is because the former can act in a disciplined way, while the latter cannot do so.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nDiscipline is necessary in student life because by learning discipline a student can be a successful citizen in future. The students who learn discipline from their earlylife can tackle any problem in future. So, learning discipline in student life is a must.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe planets move in discipline. They are bound to obey rules and regulations of the universe. As a result, there is no possibility of clash and conflict among them. Thus discipline can be learnt from the disciplined movement of the planets.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe institution that follows discipline runs well. But it fails when it is without discipline. A good institution follows rules and regulations strictly.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nDiscipline brings success for one who follows it. The great men of the world followed discipline strictly. They never did anything against rules and regulations. All the time they advised the next generation to be disciplined, dutiful, sincere, punctual and gentle.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nDiscipline is development. Absence of discipline causes downfall in every walk of life. Discipline draws a sharp line of distinction between men and beasts.

The Karnaphuli issues from the Lusai Mountains, the other rivers issue from the&nbsp;Himalayas and they all flow into the Bay of Bengal. All these rivers have their branches and tributaries. They spread over the country as a network. Thus these rivers give a new identity to our country as riverine Bangladesh.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe rivers are very useful to our life. They are helpful to our agriculture. We use our river water to irrigate our land. We can store river water during the rainy season and use them in dry season.

Many people lead their lives by catching and selling fish got from rivers.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe people of Bangladesh are greatly influenced by the rivers.

Men depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen, food, furniture, etc and take in carbondioxide which is harmful to human beings and all animals. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern.&nbsp;\u003Cbr /\u003E\nFirst, it is important to know what trees do for us. Trees are useful to us in various ways. Man needs oxygen. In every breath we take oxygen in and leave carbon dioxide out. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food and shelter. We cannot live without the help of trees.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nBut at present people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting them down mainly for firewood and furniture. Every day our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nTropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. But at present they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, &#39;Greenhouse Effect&#39; has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Ice is melting in the South and the North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. We should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop cutting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E depend on - নির্ভর করা; provide - যোগান দেওয়া; a matter of great regret - অত্যন্ত দুঃখের বিষয়; necessary thing - প্রয়োজনীয় বস্তুসামগ্রী; shelter - আশ্রয়; a large scale - ব্যাপক হ্যার; firewood - জ্বালানির কাঠ; additional people - বাড়তি জনসংখ্যা; tropical - গ্রীষ্ম প্রধান; high rate - উচ্চ হারে; effect of deforestation - বন উজাড় করার ফলাফল বা প্রভাব; heat waves - তাপ প্রবাহ; grasped - গ্রাস করেছে; melting - গলে যাচ্ছে; measures - পদক্ষেপ; otherwise - অন্যথায়; uninhabitable - বসবাসের অযোগ্য।",

A journey by train is especially pleasant for everyone. It is because a journey by train is safe and comfortable. Whenever I get a chance to have a journey by train, I never miss it.

I wanted to put my head out of the train window, but my parents did not let me. Fresh wind began to enter into our compartment. I looked through the window and saw the beautiful sights. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. They were tossing their heads in the breeze. Suddenly, the train rushed forward crossing a bridge. I saw some sailing boats in the river. Sometimes, our train moved through open fields. I saw the farmers working in the fields and children were playing cricket. All these gave me new and exciting experiences.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nOur compartment was crowded. There was no vacant seat. Some of the passengers were talking on various topics. Some were reading newspapers or magazines. Some were sleeping. Sometimes, hawkers came with various items. Our train touched at a few big and small stations.

When we were entering into Chattogram, we saw many hills.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAt last, we reached the destination safe and sound at 4 p.m. By making this journey by train, I got much enjoyment.

Spring is one of them. It is the best and the most charming of all the seasons. The Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra make this season. I like this season most.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAmong the seasons, the spring occupies a very high position. To me the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the&nbsp;rainy season bring great sufferings for us. The autumn and the late autumn have more or less the disadvantages of the rainy season and the winter respectively. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWith the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. Everything of nature looks fresh. The sky looks clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves, flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard. The melodious notes of the cuckoo please our ears.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAll these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People enjoy a better health. They are happier in this season. Besides, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available in this time.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe season lasts for a very short period. During this season, some people suffer from some diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox. Pox is a common disease in this season.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn spite of its few disadvantages, its advantages are more. Truly speaking, its actual stay in Bangladesh is not more than two or three weeks. Perhaps its short stay has made it dearer to us. For all these reasons, I like spring most.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E&nbsp;spring - বসন্তকাল; dull and lifeless - বিষা এবং প্রাণহীন; scorching sun - প্রখর রোদ; miserable - দুর্বিসহ/দুঃসহনীয়; flood - বন্যা ; suffering - ভোগান্তি; disadvantage - অসুবিধা; inconvenience - অসুবিধা/বিড়ম্বনা/কষ্ট/পীড়া; captivate - বিমোহিত/বিমুগ্ধ/সম্মোহিত করা; nature looks fresh - প্রকৃতিকে সতেজ দেখায়; sky looks clear and blue - আকাশ পরিষ্কার এবং নীল দেখায়; trees put forth new leaves - গাছে গাছে নতুন পাতা গজায়; melodious - সুরেলা; cuckoo - কোকিল; joy and mirth - আনন্দ এবং আমোদ-আহ্লাদ; diseases - রোগজীবাণু/রোগ/অসুখ; in spite of - সত্ত্বেও।",

It is devastating and horrible at it causes a colossal loss to lives and properties. It is like a curse of nature on us.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nHeavy rainfall often causes flood. Blockage of water also causes flood. In our country, flood is caused mainly due to heavy rainfall, blockage of water and release of too much water from the Farakka Barrage.

There is a scarcity of food and pure drinking water all around. The areas affected by flood become muddy and unhealthy. The prices of all daily necessary goods go up.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe government tries to take proper steps for the sufferers. Some voluntary organisations and NGOs help the affected people. They provide relief goods, medicines etc to them.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIt is not an easy task to check floods. Firstly, drainage system should be improved. Secondly, river beds should be dredged. Thirdly, a well planned irrigation system should be introduced. Fourthly, we should build our houses on high land.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nFlood has some good sides too. Silt scatters on lands and it makes the soil fertile. Sometimes various kinds of crops grow more on these fertile lands.

But it becomes a problem for a country when the country fails to provide them with employment opportunity and the basic needs of life. Bangladesh is an oyerpopulated country. Her population is growing rapidly. As a result, population has now become a great problem for Bangladesh.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe present growth rate of population in Bangladesh is 1.37%. It has made the country a crowded land. If this present growth rate continues, the population of Bangladesh will be doubled soon. Thus the growth of population is a challenge to our existence as a nation.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThere are many causes of over population. Illiteracy is one of the main causes. Moreover, ignorance, early marriage, some social and religious superstitions, unemployment of rural women etc. are responsible for over population.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nPopulation explosion is destroying all the efforts for our development. Our population is increasing, but the land is fixed. Other facilities for living are not increasing. So, the problems of shelter, food, clothing, medical treatment, housing, education, entertainment etc are increasing. It also causes various disturbances in the society. Because of it, everything becomes difficult. So, various socio-economic and political problems are being created for population explosion in Bangladesh.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWe must come forward to control our population. We should adopt family planning measures effectively. Each family must live in a planned way. No family should have more than two children. Early marriage must be banned. Mass education should be increased as an educated person can realize the problem of over population. People should be made aware of the social and religious superstitions.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nOver population has become one of the most concerns for our country. It must be checked as early as possible.

It often carries important messages, such as opinions or protests against unfair issues. Graffiti helps people express their feelings and ideas in creative ways.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nDuring the July Revolution of 2024, graffiti became a powerful tool for protest. As part of the protest, students painted a mural with the words, &#39;Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?&#39; Although the graffiti was erased the next morning, it left a strong impact.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAfter the fall of the dictatorial government on 5 August 2024, graffiti spread across the nation. Students painted walls to honor martyrs and support the July revolution. Graffiti carried slogans like &quot;Lakho shahider rokte kena, deshta karo baper na!&quot; Walls in Dhaka were filled with symbols like clenched fists and the rising sun.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nGraffiti gives freedom of speech and brings attention to ignored issues.
