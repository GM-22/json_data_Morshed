One day she met a group of people who came to her village from the Grameen Bank. They said they were interested in helping the poor people, the landless (ভূমিহীন) and the helpless. She learnt from them that only the poor and landless people were eligible (যোগ্য) ones to take a loan from the bank. However, before they could borrow (ঋণ) money. they would have to make 5-6 groups of workers. Bilkis immediately started to look for people. Soon - the necessary groups were formed. All the group members became registered members of the Grameen Bank project. Bilkis&#39; group elected a Chairperson. The group Chairperson would be responsible (দায়ী) for discipline in the group. Members would conduct (পরিচালনা করা) their business with the bank through her. They were fully aware of the rules and procedures (প্রক্রিয়া) governing the activities of the group.

In this way she became self reliant (আত্মনির্ভরশীল),\u003Cbr /\u003EEventually, all her family members started living happily with solvency."

After a while, he came to a vineyard. He was very tempted at the sight of grapes. But the grapes were hanging very high. The grapes were too high for him to reach. The fox felt greedy to see the grapes. He wanted to have some of them. So he was thinking how he could reach the grapes. But there was no way to reach the grapes. So finding no other alternative he ran and jumped high to catch the nearest bunch of grapes. He made several attempts but all were in vain. Each time he missed the juicy grapes. At last he became tired and disappointed. He thus, consoled himself saying, &quot;I did not really sa mean to have these grapes. These grapes are sour indeed.&quot;\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E"
