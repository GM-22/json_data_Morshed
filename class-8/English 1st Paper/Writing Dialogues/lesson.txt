And as we are students, it is the perfect period for us to build up the habit of punctuality.\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself : But why is punctuality so important in student life?\u003Cbr /\u003EZarif : Well, every work has a particular time to start and finish.

What do you think is its reason?\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself : I think, illiteracy (নিরক্ষরতা) is at the root of all poverty.

It&#39;s no longer just students-people from all walks of life are joining in!\u003Cbr /\u003ENeeloy : Yeah, I noticed that too. It started with students demanding a merit-based system instead of the quota system. Butnow it&#39;s transformed into something bigger, with people calling for major political change.\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself : Exactly. I think people are just fed upwith the systemic inequality and lack of fairness. The quota system was only the tip of the iceberg, but it&#39;s clear there are so many more issues people want addressed.\u003Cbr /\u003ENeeloy : And it&#39;s incredible how this movementgained momentum so quickly. When it began, I didn&#39;t expect it to lead to demands for the government to step down. But I guess it reflects how much frustration has built up over the years.\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself : Definitely. The government&#39;s rigidstance and lack of response have only fueled people&#39;s anger. Seeing students lead this fight for a fairer system really inspired others to join in, and now it&#39;s like the whole nation is demanding change.\u003Cbr /\u003ENeeloy :It&#39;s powerful, isn&#39;t it?\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself : Absolutely. And I think it also bringshope for the future. When a movement can start with just students pushing for academic fairness and evolve to address national issues, it shows that people want and believe in change.\u003Cbr /\u003ENeeloy : True, this is a pivotal moment for Bangladesh. It&#39;s like people are realizing their power to hold the government accountable and demand a fairer society. Let&#39;s hope this unity leads to real transformation.\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself : I agree.

So students as well as the common people face problems in learning this language. Yet, it is very essential for us. Now, write a dialogue between you and your teacher about how to learn English well.

        "solution": "Abid: Sir, have you thought a matter that the importance of English is increasing day by day?\u003Cbr /\u003ETeacher : Yes, you&#39;ve raised an important term. To enter into any international aspect, knowing English is a must.\u003Cbr /\u003EAbid: That means we have to put stress much on learning English, haven&#39;t we?\u003Cbr /\u003ETeacher :Yes, you&#39;ve raised an important term. To enter into any international aspect, knowing English is a must.\u003Cbr /\u003EAbid: That means we have to put stress much on learning English, haven&#39;t we?\u003Cbr /\u003ETeacher :Of course. As English is an international language, we can&#39;t but learn English.\u003Cbr /\u003EAbid: But a question is how we can learn English well. I&#39;ve heard regarding communicative method of learning English. Can you explain it?\u003Cbr /\u003ETeacher : Sure. Communicative method of learning English comprises four language skills. They are listening, speaking, reading and writing.\u003Cbr /\u003EAbid :But how can we develop these skills?\u003Cbr /\u003ETeacher :You can listen to English discussion, programme, and news in English.\u003Cbr /\u003EAbid: Can&#39;t we speak English to one another in the class?\u003Cbr /\u003ETeacher :Of course. It&#39;s an excellent idea. We can also speak aloud to ourselves while we are alone.\u003Cbr /\u003EAbid : We have to learn words and their meanings too.\u003Cbr /\u003ETeacher : Right you are. At the same time you should use these words in sentences in your practical life.\u003Cbr /\u003EAbid : Thank you sir, for your valuable suggestion.\u003Cbr /\u003ETeacher :Thank you too."

Shouldn&#39;t we take remedial measures?\u003Cbr /\u003EBabul : Of course. We must do this first.\u003Cbr /\u003EAzad : The most effective way to prevent dengue outbreak is to prevent bites by the infected Aedes mosquitoes.\u003Cbr /\u003EBabul : Right you are. We all should use mosquito repellents for that.\u003Cbr /\u003EAzad : Yes, obviously we should. But we have to reduce the mosquito population first.\u003Cbr /\u003EBabul : I do agree. We can do that by destroying their breeding places.\u003Cbr /\u003EAzad : You&#39;re absolutely correct!. To do so, we should keep our dwelling places neat and clean. No stagnant water should be allowed in and around our houses.\u003Cbr /\u003EBabul : Exactly! Besides, we need to use mosquito nets while sleeping. By the way, what should the infected people do to be recovered?\u003Cbr /\u003EAzad : Usuaully there is no direct cure for dengue. However, doctors generally suggest the infected people to take rest and drink plenty of liquids. Some medicine of paracetamol group is also prescribed.\u003Cbr /\u003EBadal : Thanks a lot for your specific information.\u003Cbr /\u003EAzad : It&#39;s pleasure, dear. You&#39;re always welcome."

Dengue is not always deadly, rather most of the dengue infected people come round soon.\u003Cbr /\u003EMy friend :Really? But how can I understand whether I get dengue or not?\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself :It&#39;s not so tough. Listen, the common symptoms include sudden high fever, severe headaches, pain behind the eyes, severe joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, etc.\u003Cbr /\u003EMy friend :Then, what if I have been alreadyinfected?\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself: That&#39;s not a serious problem, too. In that case, doctors may suggest you to take rest and drink plenty of liquids, sometimes prescribe paracetamol. However, the best way to prevent dengue fever is to avoid mosquito bites.\u003Cbr /\u003EMy friend :Then would you please tell me how&#39;s that possible?\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself :Well, to prevent mosquitoes from biting us, we can use mosquito nets and repellents. But at first we must lessen the mosquito population.\u003Cbr /\u003EMy friend :But isn&#39;t it really difficult to reduce mosquito population?\u003Cbr /\u003EMyself :Difficult, but not impossible. We should keep our living places and neighbourhoods clean and get rid stagnant water to prevent Aedes mosquitoes breeding.\u003Cbr /\u003EMy friend :Right you are.
