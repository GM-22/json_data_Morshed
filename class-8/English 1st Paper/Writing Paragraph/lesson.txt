Almost every student has a reading room. I have also owned a reading room. It faces the south. Its size is about 12 feet long and 10 feet wide. There are a door and two windows in my reading room. It is well ventilated. There are some furniture like a chair, a table, a bamboo made bookshelf and a small coach in my reading room. There are a flower calendar and two framed paintings hung on the wall in my reading room. There are a table lamp and a vase on the table. My reading room is a very quiet one. Through the window of my reading room an open field can be seen. Sometimes I become relaxed looking at the green field through the window.

The elements of the environment are being polluted in many ways. Harmful emissions from factories, and vehicles and smoke from burning trash, dust, chemicals, pollute air. Water pollution occurs from industrial waste, and the use of pesticides in agriculture. Soil is polluted by plastic and chemical waste. The effects of pollution are harmful, causing diseases like asthma, cancer, and respiratory problems. It also harms animals, plants, and natural resources. To reduce environmental pollution, we must control the use of harmful chemicals, reduce waste, and promote recycling. Planting trees and using renewable energy sources can also help. Pollution is very harmful to health because it causes breathing problems, weakens the immune system, and increases the risk of chronic diseases. Protecting the environment is essential for a healthy future, and everyone should take responsibility for it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E"

Railway engines and power houses create smoke by burning coal and oil. All kinds of smoke pollute air. By emitting carbons, factories and motor vehicles pollute air. Air pollution is acute in industrial areas. To prevent such air pollution, we should be determined and take positive steps. Industries should not be set up here and there. We should shift the mills and factories away from our locality or residential areas. Excessive smoke emitting vehicles should be banned. More trees should be planted.

Using chemical fertilizers and insecticides farmers pollute water. Rain and floods wash away these chemical fertilizers and insecticides to rivers, canals and ponds and pollute water. Mills and factories pollute water by throwing their waste into rivers and canals. People become ill by drinking and bathing in the polluted water. So,water pollution should be prevented. For this, we should not throw waste and filth into the water of the rivers and canals. On the other hand, we can purify water by boiling or filtering.

The accident took place near Farmgate. I was on a rickshaw. I saw a bus coming with full speed from northern direction. A scooter was coming from the same direction. Suddenly the bus pushed the scooter from behind. In the scooter there were three passengers including a child and a woman. The woman was run over by the bus and died on the spot. The other two were seriously wounded. People present there rushed to the spot to help them. I also rushed to the spot. I along withother ones took the wounded to the nearby hospital. I was greatly shocked at the accident. I think this kind of accident can be prevented by taking some effective steps. Traffic rules should be maintained strictly. Traffic police should be well-trained. Above all, drivers should be very careful while driving.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E"

Many young men and women are falling victims to drug addiction. It is a curse not only for themselves but also for the whole nation. There are some reasons for drug addiction such as frustration, bad association, unemployment, failure in love, degradation of religious values, lack of family peace, etc. The consequences of drug addiction are very dreadful. Malnutrition, memory loss, health deterioration, brain damage, aggressive behaviour are some of the consequences of drug addiction. We can play a role in the fight against drug addiction. The first thing to do is to highlight itsdangerous effect. The mass media can play an effective role in this respect. Availability of drugs should be stopped at any cost. Drug smugglers should be given exemplary punishment. People must co-operate with the government to uproot this problem from the society.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E"

It is because we cannot achieve anything physically, mentally or spiritually if we are unclean in our body, mind and soul. So we must follow the rules of hygiene. First, we must keep our body clean. We should have a bath every day and wash our hair regularly. This will keep the body and hair free from dirt and bacteria. Secondly, it is also important to wash our hands before meals and after using the toilet. We should brush our teeth twice aday, after breakfast and supper. We must also cut our nails regularly. Our drinking water must be pure. We can get pure water by boiling and filtering. Finally, we should keep our surroundings and environment clean.\u003C/div\u003E"

And now, they have got a supersonic speed. In a supersonic speed, something travels faster than sound! Modern aircraft companies are making revolutions in aviation technology. Boeing as well as Airbus is producing modern passenger airplanes. These planes fly very fast. Concorde is the world&#39;s fastest supersonic passenger aircraft. Its normalspeed was 2,170 km/h.

In ancient Rome, pearls were considered the greatest sign of wealth and social status. At that time the young women of noble families loved to wear beautiful pearl necklaces. The brave knights used to wear them in the battles for good luck. Pearls were obtained from pearl oysters. These oysters, were collected from the bottom of the ocean, lake or river.

But to record thoughts in writing was difficult. Writing material was not available. People used surface of stone, metal, wood, bark, leaves, etc. for writing. Those things were not easy to carry. Then for ages, people looked for easy writing materials. Finally, paper was invented in China in 105 AD. Before paper age, knowledge was very restricted. There were very few books in the world. Maybe, they were written on stone or on heavy wood plunks or on metal sheets. We can even carry a huge volume of paper encyclopedia.

He gets up early in the morning and goes to the land. He works hard on his land from dawn to dusk. Even he works in rain or sun. Most often a farmer is illiterate. He cannot apply the scientific method of cultivation. Sometimes crops fail due to natural calamities like droughts and floods. Then the misery of a farmer beggars description.

This virus spreads among people through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. These may include a high fever, severe headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains. There are no specific antibiotics to treat dengue fever. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive care. Paracetamol is recommended for fever reduction and pain relief. Taking sufficient rest is also important. For more severe cases, blood transfusion may be required. Aedes mosquitoes typically lay eggs near standing water in containers that hold water, like buckets, bowls, animal dishes, flower pots and vases. So the best method of preventing dengue includes destroying mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by throwing standing water and wearing thick clothes. Most importantly, everyone&#39;s awareness against dengue can halt the outbreak of this disease.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E"

Trees are useful to us in many ways. We get fruits, timber and flowers from trees. Trees give us oxygen and take in carbon-dioxide. They save us from natural calamities like drought, storms, floods etc. Thus they maintain ecological balance. So trees are a valuable asset to a country. If we cut down trees at random, the country will become a desert one day. But it is unfortunate that our people are cutting trees for fuel, furniture and other purposes. We should therefore plant more trees, June and July are the best time for tree plantation. By planting trees we keep our environment balanced. Besides, we should raise awareness among all to plant more trees. We must undertake a vast project for planting trees all over the country. Thus we can make tree plantation programme a success.\u003C/div\u003E"

This is why it is called international language. Without English, we cannot do anything in this modern world. More than 80% of all the information in the world&#39;s computers is in English. Organisations often need employees who speak and write a standard form of English. For business communication and correspondence with foreign countries English is a must. In the airports and hotels in foreign countries, we have no alternative except English language to communicate. I think without learning English grammar one cannot write or speak correctly. So I feel very eager to learn it. Our English textbook emphasizes all skills of learning English. By reading the book one can learn English properly.

Another one is a young boy who serves tea to the customers. A tea stall opens early in the morning. It is kept open till late hours at night. People also exchange their views and ideas sitting there. They discuss their internal problems, political issues and so on. This is why it is called a Mini Sangsad. Tea has now become the most popular drink.

The causes of street accidents are reckless driving, brake failure, overtaking, driving by unskilled drivers and violation of traffic rules. However, recently I witnessed a terrible street accident at Farmgate in Dhaka. A rickshaw puller was pulling two college girls to Farmgate. At that time, a driver of a pick-up van pushed back the rickshaw. Then and there the two girls were run over by the van. They were spot dead. But the rickshaw puller escaped narrowly. The road was covered with blood. Street accidentcan be prevented by all out efforts from both the authorities and the general mass. To do so, first our general people will have to be made aware of traffic rules. The drivers will have to be skilled. Unskilled drivers should not be given any license. And the authorities should be more strict to enforce the traffic rules. If anyone violates traffic rules, he/she should be given exemplary punishment.\u003C/div\u003E"

Passengers get down and get into a train from a railway station. There are waiting rooms for male and female passengers. There are ticket counter, the booking office for goods, restaurants, book stalls, station master&#39;s room etc in a railway station. A railway station is a noisy place because of the loud sounds of trains, announcements, people&#39;s talking, and the constant movement of passengers and luggage. Hawkers are also very active here. They shout to sell their goods. There are a large number of porters here to carry luggage. Sometimes passengers become victim of pick-pockets and harassment of the porters. When a train arrives, the station becomes more busy. When a train leaves the station, it becomes calm and quiet again.
