        "explanation": "Victory Day of Bangladesh is on 16 December because on that day in 1971 the Pakistani forces formally surrendered, ending the nine-month Liberation War and securing Bangladesh’s independence. We observe this date to honor the fighters’ sacrifices and remember the nation’s birth after the war.",

        "explanation": "The scientist is correct: gravity is the universal attractive force between masses that, near Earth’s surface, pulls objects toward the planet’s center and makes things like apples fall.

        "question": "during the recent power crisis due to fuel shortage the government requested everyone to save electricity and reduce unnecessary use of air conditioners and lights",
        "solution": "During the recent power crisis due to fuel shortage, the government requested everyone to save electricity and reduce unnecessary use of air conditioners and lights.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: The request is correct because when fuel is scarce power plants cannot generate enough electricity, so lowering use of air conditioners and lights reduces total demand and helps prevent widespread outages. Conserving electricity during a shortage also stretches the limited fuel supply, ensuring essential services get power and reducing the need for severe rationing.",

        "explanation": "Bangladesh is especially vulnerable because much of the country is low-lying and densely populated, so sea-level rise, more intense cyclones, flooding and salinization directly threaten homes, crops and livelihoods. Since these climate impacts are driven by global emissions and adapting requires large finance, technology and capacity, Bangladesh needs international support to build resilience and protect its people.",

For example, \"The river erosion takes a devastating turn with the onset of the monsoon.\" and \"Vast tracts of cultivable land have been washed away by eroding rivers.\" are correct because the verb forms (takes, have been) agree with their subjects and the phrases together make complete, meaningful sentences.",

        "question": "Change the following passage into direct speech :\n\nTakrim asked Srabon when his JSC Examination commenced. Srabon replied that it commenced on the 1st November. Hearing this Takrim told Srabon that his JSC Examination is knocking at the door and he didn't have a lot of time. At this, Srabon remarked that he was right and so he was learning his lessons with profound attention.",
        "solution": "Takrim said to Srabon, “When does your JSC Examination commence?”\n\nSrabon said, “It commences on the 1st November.”\n\nTakrim said, “Your JSC Examination is knocking at the door and you don’t have a lot of time.”\n\nSrabon said, “You are right. So, I am learning my lessons with profound attention.”",
        "explanation": "WH-word “when” ছিল, তাই তা সরাসরি ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে।\n\n“Commenced” → “commence” tense পরিবর্তনের কারণে “does... commence” প্রশ্ন গঠনে ব্যবহৃত হয়েছে।\n\n“Is knocking” ও “don’t have” অপরিবর্তিত রাখা হয়েছে কারণ সময় এখনও প্রাসঙ্গিক (ongoing)।\n\n“He was learning” → “I am learning” হয়েছে কারণ Srabon নিজেই কথা বলছে।",

        "solution": "Alexander the Great was the king of Macedonia. He was the son of Philip, a mighty king of Sparta. He invaded India about 327 years before the birth of Christ. On the way, he defeated Porus and marched towards the Punjab.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: Alexander was indeed the king of Macedonia and the son of Philip II of Macedonia; he crossed into the Indian subcontinent around 327 BC and defeated King Porus at the Battle of the Hydaspes (326 BC), after which he advanced into the Punjab. The passage’s main error is calling Philip a king of Sparta—Philip ruled Macedonia, not Sparta—so the sequence (Alexander’s parentage, invasion, victory over Porus, and advance into Punjab) is otherwise correct.",

        "explanation": "This is true because vegetables and fruits are rich in vitamins (for example vitamin C and A) and minerals (like potassium and iron) that the body needs. These nutrients help build and repair tissues and strengthen the immune system, so eating them reduces the risk of infections and other diseases.",

        "explanation": "Rafiq’s reply is correct because he immediately apologized and gave a brief, truthful reason—he was asking Karim to lend a pen since his own had run out—so his response shows politeness and explanation.

        "explanation": "Both speakers are right in different ways: technology can make tasks faster and more productive by automating routine work, improving communication, and giving quick access to information. At the same time, overreliance on devices can weaken certain skills, reduce physical activity, and encourage shortcuts that feel like laziness. The overall effect depends on how people use technology—mindful, limited use boosts efficiency, while careless dependence can lead to decline in habits and abilities.",

Trees provide shelter to birds and animals.\n\nExplanation: Each sentence is made by selecting a suitable subject, verb and complement from the table and arranging them in correct English order, with verb forms chosen to match meaning (e.g., \"are\" with an adjective phrase, \"provide\" with an object). This ensures clear subject–verb agreement and logical meaning about the roles of trees.",

        "explanation": "Tolerance \\textbf{is} one of the best qualities of a person. Every conscious person should bear this great quality. In human society one person may not \\textbf{like} another person. One may have grudge against the other. But he must \\textbf{create} tolerance to live peacefully in the society. A man who \\textbf{is} devoid of tolerance \\textbf{has} his problems himself.(a) “Is” – general fact. (b) After modal “may not” → base verb “like”. (c) “Must” → modal + base “create”. (d) Passive relative clause → “who is”. (e) Present tense → “has” (he has his problems).",
