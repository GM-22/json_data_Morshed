Businessman read the paper to know market&nbsp;conditions. Sportsmen amuse themselves with sports-news. A professor or a teacher gathers news and views on literary topics.

Students read newspaper to supplement the education that they receive at schools and colleges. It is our good companion in our solitary hours or in a railway compartment.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nA newspaper is the powerful instrument of publicity (প্রচার).
