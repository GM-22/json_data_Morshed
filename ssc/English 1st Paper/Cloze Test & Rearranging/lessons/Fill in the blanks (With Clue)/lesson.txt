        "question": "Mainul Islam is a qualified farmer in Naogaon. Mr Islam was very brilliant as a student. He took his higher education from Bangladesh Agricultural University in Mymensingh. He then came back home and started advanced farming. He has two other brothers who are graduates in different disciplines. The specialty of the Islam family is that they all are living in their village and all are renowned in their own fields. Mr. Islam's younger brother, who is a Rajshahi University graduate, is a science teacher in a local school. His youngest brother is a social science graduate who likes to start a local NGO to work for this area. When asked \"What makes you decide to stay here in this village?\" Mr Islam smiled and said, \"Look, it's true that we could leave this village for city life. I could be a banker or my brothers could be bureaucrats. But it didn't attract us. We are sons of this soil. Yes, we have education but does education prepare a person only to be an officer? Don't we have any obligation to the soil that has made us what we are?\" He also added that not every educated individual should be a job seeker. He added that since his discipline was agriculture, after his education he took the occupation of a farmer. In response to the question whether they had any frustration living in a village, he confirmed that they were indeed very pleased with their life. He said, \"I work in my own farm, stay with my family members, pass time with my old friends, and sleep at my own home. All these count a lot.\"\n\nMr Islam is right. Many people go to cities and forget or loosen their roots knowingly or unknowingly. Mr Islam and his brothers are great they haven't forgotten their roots. They not only stuck to their own roots, they have been torch bearers for others to be respectful of their roots.\n\nChoose the best answer from the alternatives.\n\n'I could be bankers and my brothers could be bureaucrats.'

There are two major types of energy sources: renewable and non-renewable. Hydro-carbon or fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. Reliance on them poses real big problems. First, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, gas, etc. are finite energy resources and the world eventually will run out of them.\n\nSecondly, they will become too expensive in the coming decades and too damaging for the environment to repair. Thirdly, fossil fuels have direct polluting impacts on earth's environment causing global warming. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as, wind and solar energy are constantly and naturally replenished and never run out.\n\nMost renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight or solar energy can be used for heating and lighting homes, for generating electricity and for other commercial and industrial uses.\n\n(a) _________ dependence on fossil fuels poses a great threat (b)___________our environment.

        "solution": "(a) Islam brothers could avail all the opportunities of city life. They could have illustrious career but they left to serve their villages. So, they can be considered great men.\n\n(b) They came back to the village because they had obligation to the soil which had made them what they were. They didn't think that every educated person should look for job.\n\n(c) Working on his own farm, staying with his family members, passing time with his old friends and sleeping at his own home- all these help Mr. Islam to lead a pleasing life.\n\n(d) According to Mr. Islam, the motto of life should be to do something for the root which means where we were born. Our education can help us do that.\n\n(e) The main theme of the passage is - we should love our native land. Forgetting our birthplace our life is meaningless. We should never forget our roots.",

        "question": "Mainul Islam is a qualified farmer in Naogaon. Mr Islam was very brilliant as a student. He took his higher education from Bangladesh Agricultural University in Mymensingh. He then came back home and started advanced farming. He has two other brothers who are graduates in different disciplines. The specialty of the Islam family is that they all are living in their village and all are renowned in their own fields. Mr. Islam's younger brother, who is a Rajshahi University graduate, is a science teacher in a local school. His youngest brother is a social science graduate who likes to start a local NGO to work for this area. When asked \"What makes you decide to stay here in this village?\" Mr Islam smiled and said, \"Look, it's true that we could leave this village for city life. I could be a banker or my brothers could be bureaucrats. But it didn't attract us. We are sons of this soil. Yes, we have education but does education prepare a person only to be an officer? Don't we have any obligation to the soil that has made us what we are?\" He also added that not every educated individual should be a job seeker. He added that since his discipline was agriculture, after his education he took the occupation of a farmer. In response to the question whether they had any frustration living in a village, he confirmed that they were indeed very pleased with their life. He said, \"I work in my own farm, stay with my family members, pass time with my old friends, and sleep at my own home. All these count a lot.\"\n\nMr Islam is right. Many people go to cities and forget or loosen their roots knowingly or unknowingly. Mr Islam and his brothers are great they haven't forgotten their roots. They not only stuck to their own roots, they have been torch bearers for others to be respectful of their roots.\n\nChoose the best answer from the alternatives.\n\nWhich quality describes Mainul best?",
