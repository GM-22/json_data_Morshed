He was caught by a slave merchant who sold him to a rich man in another country. His master was very bad and inflicted heavy torture on him. Androcles was very homesick. One day he fled from his master's house and took shelter in a cave. In the evening a lion entered the cave. The lion seemed wounded as he was groaning. He came near Androcles and lifted his paw. He took the lion's paw in his hand and removed a big thorn from it. The lion was relieved of his pain.",

For example, (a) uses \"is situated\" + \"to the south of Bangladesh\" to state location, (b) uses the defining clause \"stretches for miles\" before the identifying fact \"is the longest sea beach,\" and (d) places the relative clause \"which is a coral island\" before the location phrase for a clear, natural sentence.",
