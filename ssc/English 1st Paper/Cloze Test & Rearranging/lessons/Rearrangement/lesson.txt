        "solution": "Correct Order of the Parts of the Story: (a)→(c)→(d)→(h)→(f)→(b)→(e)→(g)\n\nHelp: Full Story\n\nPenicillin is a life saving medicine. It was discovered by Dr. Alexander Fleming. Fleming was born in a poor family in Scotland. He was the seventh of the eight brothers and sisters. He passed his boyhood with his parents. He was a very bright, attentive and regular student. The school was four miles away from his home. He went to school and came back home on foot. He was never absent from school up to the age of twelve years. He was sent to London, at the age of fourteen for higher education.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: The order begins with the general fact about penicillin (a) and then names its discoverer (c); (d)–(h) give Fleming’s family background and student qualities, while (f), (b) and (e) logically describe his long walk to school and consistent attendance, forming a coherent childhood sequence. Finally (g) completes the timeline by showing the outcome—he was sent to London at age fourteen—so the sentences follow a clear chronological and logical flow.",

He was the eldest son of his parents. He lost his father in 1804 and his mother in 1810. In 1811 Keats became an apprentice to a surgeon at Edmonton. But his heart was not in medicine and he felt that he was born to be a poet. Finally he abandoned surgery for literature. His finest poems like \"Ode To a Nightingale\" \"Ode On a Grecian Um' etc. were published in 1820. This great poet met a premature death on February 23, 1821.",

This sequence follows time and cause-and-effect — personal losses and medical training lead to his turn to poetry, then publication, then death — so it makes a coherent biographical narrative.",

        "solution": "c+e+g+b+a+f+d+h\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a young man named Androcles. He was caught by a slave merchant who sold him to a rich man. His master was very bad and inflicted heavy torture on him. Androcles was very home-sick. One day he left from his master's house and took shelter in a cave. In the evening a lion entered the cave. The lion seemed wounded as it was groaning. It came near Androcles and lifted its paw. He took the lions paw in his hand and removed a big throne from it. The lion was relieved from its pain.",
        "explanation": "Solution: The correct chronological order is (c) → (g) → (e) → (b) → (a) → (f) → (d) → (h). Each sentence logically follows the previous one—Androcles lived and suffered under a cruel master, was sold, fled and hid in a cave where a wounded lion arrived, showed its injured paw, and Androcles removed the thorn, relieving its pain—so the sequence is driven by time order and clear cause–effect links.",

He discovered that many diseases are caused by germs and he also found curses for several of them. At first, he only treated animals because he did not want to cause the death of any human being. He found a mad dog and injected some weak germs of its diseases into blood. The dog was cured. One day a boy named Joseph Meister was brought to Pasteur.

The underlying concept is vaccination: using weakened germs to produce immunity and prevent disease.",
