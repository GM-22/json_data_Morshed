        "solution": "[math]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/math] An Old Woman Who Told TalesOne day a school boy named Arif was returning home from school. On the way to his home, he saw an old woman who was begging. Arif asked the woman why she was begging. In reply, she told him that she was once one of the richest women in a town. But fate has brought her on the streets making her beg for money. Saying this, the woman started to cry which caught Arif off guard. He asked her whether she would like to drink some warm tea since the weather was cold. The offer brought a smile on the woman's wrinkled face. Near the dying river, there was an old tea store that Arif loved to visit. So he took the woman there for some tea. When he came to order their drinks at the counter, the owner told him that his companion told the strangest tales. No one knew where she came from and she had told thousand different stories to everyone who asked. With two cups of tea and newly learnt information, Arif returned to the old woman confused. The old woman smiled at him and began telling him about how she lost all her money to a fire. Arif took slow sips of his drink and started listening to the story in astonishment.Word Meaning: begging (adj) – ভিক্ষা করছিল; wrinkled (adj) কুঞ্চিত, ভাজপড়া; dying river (phr) - মৃতপ্রায় নদী; counter (n) – দোকান; strangest tale (phr) বিস্ময়কর গল্প; companion (n) সঙ্গী; confused (adj) বিহ্বল; sip (n) – চুমুক; astonishment (n) বিস্ময়।",
        "explanation": "Explanation: The added sentences complete the story by stating why the woman begged, showing Arif’s reaction, and resolving the situation through his choices (helping her, finding help, or learning a lesson). This is correct because a good ending follows a clear structure—problem, response, and outcome—which makes the narrative coherent and teaches the moral (empathy and responsibility). Students should use this pattern to craft satisfying endings that show character growth and a logical consequence of earlier events.",

        "solution": "There lived a poor woodcutter. Although he was very poor, he was honest. Every day he went to a forest beside a river for cutting wood. He earned his livelihood by selling wood in the market. One day while he was cutting wood near a pond, suddenly his axe fell into the pond.\n\nThe pond was very deep. The woodcutter did not know how to swim or dive. So, he was sitting there sadly. Then a wonderful thing happened. A beautiful fairy appeared. before the woodcutter. She asked him in a sweet voice. \"Why are you so sad? Why are you not cutting wood?\" The woodcutter replied sorrowfully. \"My axe has fallen into the pond. I can't cut wood now.\" The fairy then showed him an axe made of gold. She asked him if it was his axe. The wood cutter saw the axe and said. \"It's not my axe.\" The fairy showed him. another axe made of silver, she asked, \"Is this the axe that you lost?\" The woodcutter said, \"No, it's not. My axe is made of iron.\" The fairy showed him the lost axe.\n\nThe woodcutter then said happily that it was his axe. The fairy became very pleased and gave him the gold and the silven axes too. Then the woodcutter became rich and began. to live happily.",
        "explanation": "Because the woodcutter told the truth and refused to claim the valuable axes that were not his, the river spirit rewarded him; this directly shows why the answer about his honesty (or returning what was found) is correct. The underlying concept is that honesty and integrity build trust and often bring positive consequences, while greed leads to loss or punishment.",

He claimed in front of the mayor that he could help the town get rid of the rats. It was a golden opportunity only a fool would miss. So, the mayor hired the stranger and promised him a thousand gold coins if he succeeded. Being satisfied with the offer, the pied piper started to play his pipe and walked through the streets of Hamelin. The sweet melody of the pipe brought the rats out in the street and had them trail behind the pied piper. The man cunningly brought the rats near the river and each of them was washed away with its strong current. Then he returned to the mayor to get his pay, but the mayor went back on his words.

        "solution": "[math]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/math] King Midas: The Golden TouchOnce upon a time, there was a king called Midas. He was very rich. Yet he always longed for more riches. Moreover, he was fond of gold though he had a lot of it. He thought if he had the golden touch, he would be the happiest man. A wise God granted his wish promptly. One morning, he got up early and started walking around in his garden as usual and touched a white rose in the garden. Then he saw, to his utter surprise, that the flower had turned into a piece of white gold. He was amazed and touched another plant which, in an instant, turned into gold. It was really amusing to him. He started playing with his new found blessing. Right at this moment, his only daughter entered the garden. When he embraced his daughter to share his delight with her, to his sheer grief, he found her being turned into a statue of gold. He became very shocked at this and prayed to God to take back the destructive blessing. After few moments, the girl came to life. The king became happy.Word Meaning: Word Meaning: long (v) আকাঙ্ক্ষা করা; grant (v) প্রদান করা/মঞ্জুর করা; promptly (adv) - তক্ষুণি/শীঘ্র; utter surprise (phr) হতবাক; in an instant (adv) এক মুহূর্তেই; embrace (v) আলিঙ্গন করা; delight (n) - আনন্দ; sheer grief (phr) - নিদারুণ শোক; statue (n) মূর্তি; destructive (adj) ধ্বাংসাত্মক।",

        "solution": "[math]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/math] Honesty of a Rickshaw-pullerOnce there lived a poor rickshaw puller. He had to maintain his family consisting of eight members with great ditficulty. One day while walking through the fields, he found a purse dropped by a passer-by. He picked the purse up and found a lot of money in it. He said, \"It might be dropped by a passer-by.\" He looked for the owner for sometimes, but found no one. He took the bag to his home and showed it to his wife. His wife said to him, \"God has given this money to us and so we should use it to remove our poor condition.\" The rickshaw puller said, \"No, it does not belong to us. I should look for the owner.\" The next day, the rickshaw puller was waiting in that place where he found the purse thinking that the owner might come in search of it. After a long time, he noticed a man looking for something. The rickshaw puller rushed to the man and came to know that the purse belonged to him. He took the man to his home and handed over the bag. The man was very pleased at the honesty of the rickshaw puller. The man was very rich and he gave the rickshaw puller a good job with high salary in his farm. The rickshaw puller and his family became pleased and they were no more in want.Word Meaning: maintain (v) ভরণপোষণ করা; difficulty (n)- অসুবিধা; additional (adj) - অতিরিক্ত; passer-by (n)- পহিক; drop (v) - পড়া; remove (v) - অপসারণ করা; condition (n) - অবস্থা; belong to (v) - অধিকারভুক্ত হওয়া; look for (v) - সন্ধান করা; rush (v) - তীব্রবেগে যাওয়া; hand over (v) - হস্তান্তর করা।",
        "explanation": "A correct completion follows the story’s setup: the rickshaw puller’s poverty, the found purse, and the moral choice, so the events and his decisions remain believable and consistent. Good endings show clear cause-and-effect (his choice leads to specific consequences for his family) and reveal character motives (compassion, honesty, or desperation) to make the resolution convincing. Keeping the tone and details consistent ensures the reader accepts the outcome and grasps the story’s message.",

        "solution": "[math]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/math] A King's MistakeOnce there lived a King in an island. There were green trees everywhere in the island. The King decided to build a magnificent palace in the island. So he ordered his men to cut down all the trees. Some opposed the King's idea but he did not pay any heed to them. All the trees were cut, a palace was built and the King continued to live his day in pride inside the new shiny walls of his prized possession. It was only he who unconsciously and with folly kept living in the palace until he realized that his kingdom had begun to deteriorate. There was no rice in the granary, no fruit in the storehouse, no fish in the pond and no peace among the people. One afternoon, he took a step outside the palace and, for a second, mistook his green island for a barren land. The air was so uncomfortably warm that he even struggled to breathe. The common people outside his gate were watching him suffer in silence. With no delay, the King realized he had made a grave mistake and had lost his kingdom, his lands and his people. But it was not too late because he still had a little time left to fix his mistake. He couldn't but ask his people to help him save the island because he had now realized he was not the sole owner of it. The island belonged to everyone.Word Meaning: island (n); magnificent (adj) - জমকালো; palace (n); pride (n) - গর্ব/অষংকার; realized (v) - বুঝতে পারলো; deteriorate (v) - অবনতি ঘটানো; barren (adj) - অনুর্বর; silence(n) - নিরবতা; sole(adj) - একক; owner (n) - মালিক; belonged (v) - অধিকারে থাকা।",
        "explanation": "The correct continuation shows the consequences of the king’s decision—how cutting all the trees affects the island and its people—so readers can follow a clear cause-and-effect arc. It should include conflict (those who opposed him), events that escalate the problem, and a resolution (change of heart, restoration, or consequence) to give the story meaning. This structure helps teach responsibility, leadership, and environmental impact in a simple, chronological way.",

But no one noticed whether there was actually any fire or not. Having just heard the news, without any confirmation, all the workers of the factory became desperate to come outside.But the factory had only one exit and the path which led to this gate was very narrow. Even three men or women could not pass through this path side by side at a time. So, when all the workers of the factory were trying to come out along this narrow path, the path became congested with the workers. Many workers feli down on the path because of the jostling in the crowd and were trampled by other workers. Some of them received severe injuries. In a word, a chaotic situation had been prevailing in the factory. After observing the situation, the authority of the factory took steps to pacify the workers. The authority announced through loud speaker that the news was a rumour and no fire had broken out. Actually, a pipe containing colour had burst out in the dying section but it caused no casualties. After hearing this announcement twice, the workers understood their follies and went back to their work.Word Meaning: ill news (phr) - খারাপ সংবাদ; runs apace (phr) - দ্রুত ছড়ানো; confirmation (n) - নিশ্চিতকরণ; desperate (adj) – মরিয়া; exit (n) - প্রস্থান; narrow (adj) - সর; congested (adj) -জনাকীর্ণ; jostle (v) ধাজ্ঞাধাজি কর trample (v) - পদদলিত করা; chaotic situation (phr) - বিশৃঙ্খল অবস্থা; pacify (v) - শান্ত করা; announce (v) - যোবলা দেওয়া; rumour (n) – গুজব; burst out (v)- বিস্ফোরিত হওয়া; casualty (n) - ক্ষয়ক্ষতি/দুর্ঘটনা।",

        "solution": "[math]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/math] You Win Some, You Lose SomeTamim, a student of class ten, was returning from school. On the way, he saw some boys and girls bathing in the pond. Suddenly, he heard a girl shouting \"Help! Help! Save me!\" Tamim quickly ran towards them to assess the situation. From a distance he noticed the girl waving her hands in the air desperately. Since there was no time, he dived into the water wearing his clothes. He even forgot to take off his backpack. Although he was never a good swimmer, sensing the danger the girl was in, he swam to the middle very quickly. He grabbed the girl's hand and helped her reach the edge of the pond. Near the edge, the boys who were swimming earlier stood concerned. They helped Tamim bring the girl out of the water. Once their feet touched the land, Tamim took a breath of relief and sat down to catch his breath. With drenched clothes and ruined notebooks, he listened to the boys explaining how the girl floated away from them and almost drowned. Everyone thanked him and in reply he could only smile. He was glad that the only thing he couldn't save that day was his notebooks.Word Meaning: quickly (adv)- দ্রুত; distance (n.) দূরত্ব; waving (v.)- নাড়াচ্ছিল; desperately (adv) - মরিয়া হয়ে; dived (v) - ডুব দিল; forgot (v.) - ভুলে গেল; backpack(n.) - গাড়ি-বোচকা; grabbed (v.) - ধরলো; edge (n.) - প্রান্ত; breath (n) নিঃশ্বাস; relief (n) - স্বস্তি; floated (v) ভেসে গেল; glad (adj) আনন্দিত।",

Her poor parents have two other little children. It is hard for her illiterate parents to earn enough to run the family well. Dilara hopes to bring about a change to her family by receiving higher education. So she makes a promise to herself to study well from here on. One of her teachers once told her that there are schools in Swapnopur that offers scholarship to bright students. Getting a scholarship would help her pursue the promise she made to herself. So, with strong determination and hard work, Dilara got good results in her final examinations. The school gifted her and other top students a bundle of books to applaud their effort. Dilara finished reading all of her book long before New Year. She was motivated by the idea that if she worked hard, a positive outcome would follow. However, the journey ahead proved to be a challenge. There is not always a positive outcome no matter how hard one works. But Dilara's old promise helped her stand firm on her ground.

        "solution": "The Farmer and the Nobleman\n\nOne day, a farmer was taking some sacks of wheat to a mill. The mill was a few kilometers away. On the way, the horse stumbled and one of the sacks fell onto the ground. It was too heavy for the farmer to lift and there was nobody around to help him. He was at a loss. Meanwhile, he saw a horseman coming towards him. His heart jumped. As the rider was coming nearer, the farmer recognized him. He was the nobleman who lived in a big house at the top of the hill. The farmer thought that it was not proper for him to seek help from the person of. a high rank. So, he dared not approach the rider. The nobleman was very generous. He stopped in front of the farmer and got down from the horse and came forward to help the farmer willingly. Then he held one end of the sack and asked the farmer to hold the other end. Together they lifted the sack and placed it once again on the horse's back. The farmer took off his cap and wanted to offer thanks to the nobleman. But the nobleman took it as a humanitarian duty and suggested him do the same in others' distress.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: A continuation in which the farmer discovers the sack torn and either recovers the spilled wheat or receives help is correct because it follows cause and effect — the stumble causes the spill, so the story must show a realistic consequence and a response. This teaches the underlying concepts of narrative coherence (actions lead to believable outcomes) and character development, since the farmer’s reaction (problem-solving, asking for help, or showing honesty) reveals the story’s theme or moral. Keeping the resolution tied to the initial event helps readers understand consequences and the lesson the tale intends to convey.",

He took the bundle of money and went to his class teacher.\"Ayat, what brings you here?\" asked his teacher. \"Ma'am, I found this bundle of money on my way to school. I thought I should give it to you. Maybe someone lost it,\" replied Ayat. His teacher was impressed by Ayat's honesty and kindness. She checked the bundle of money, found a small note with a name and phone number. She called the number and informed the person that Ayat had found the money. It turned out that the money belonged to an old woman who had saved it up for her grandson's treatment. She had lost it while going back from the bank. The old woman was grateful when she got her money back. Then she thanked Ayat and his teacher for their honesty and kindness. She even invited Ayat to her house and gave him some home-cooked sweets as a token of gratitude. Ayat felt happy to see the smile on the old woman's face. He realized that helping others could bring joy and happiness to one's life. He decided to start a small charity program in his school to help the poor and needy.",
        "explanation": "Taking the bundle to his class teacher is the right choice because it shows honesty and prevents Ayat from keeping what does not belong to him. Returning lost property helps the real owner get it back and teaches responsibility, respect for others' rights, and builds trust. In practice, informing a trusted adult or authority ensures the money is recorded and kept safe until the rightful owner claims it.",

Every morning, she started for school and came back home in the afternoon. One day after coming back home, to her utter surprise, she found a lock hanging on the door. At first, she tried to open the lock with her key, but it did not budge. She knocked on the door, but no one answered. Panic set in, and she wondered what could have happened. She felt alone and scared, but she didn't lose hope. She went to the back of the house to see if there was any way she could get in. Fortunately, one of the windows was open. She somehow managed to get inside. The first thing she noticed was that the house was in complete disarray. She realized that something was terribly wrong. Rumana immediately called her parents, and they rushed home. After investigating, they found out that their house had been robbed while they were away. The robbers had taken all of their valuables, including jewelry, electronics, and cash. The incident taught Rumana the importance of being cautious and vigilant. She realized that security was a significant issue and that she needed to take measures to protect her family's belongings. In the end, the incident made Rumana stronger and more responsible. She learned to take charge of her life and to be prepared for the unexpected. She was grateful that she and her family were safe and sound.",
        "explanation": "The correct answer completes the prompt by adding at least ten coherent sentences that logically continue the given beginning and by providing a fitting title. This is right because a good continuation preserves narrative elements—character, setting, conflict—and moves them toward a clear development or resolution, showing understanding of story structure. Focus on unity, consistent voice, and a title that reflects the main theme so the story feels complete and purposeful.",

        "solution": "The Boy Who Saved the Train-\n\nOne sunny morning a boy of eleven years old was tending cattle by the side of a railway line. Suddenly he noticed a small railway slipper which was about to collapse. A little while later, he remembered that a mail train was supposed to cross in about half an hour. He thought that something should be done. Otherwise a serious accident might occur. He was thinking what to do. He was looking here and there but found none. Suddenly he remembered that if he showed red signal, the train might stop. As he was wearing a red shirt, at once he took off his shirt and hung it with a stick. Then he began to wave it in the air. The driver saw it from far away and stopped the train slowly. He came to the boy and asked what happened. The boy took him to the railway slipper. Seeing it the driver thanked him and said that he had saved them. The next day the news was published in different newspapers. The government and many institutions awarded him for his ready wit.",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is right because it continues the opening into a coherent narrative of at least ten sentences, developing what the boy notices, describing his actions and the consequences, and resolving the situation so the reader sees a clear beginning, middle and end. Keep tense and character motivation consistent, add concrete details and logical cause-and-effect so the sequence of events makes sense and the story feels complete.",

        "solution": "Escaping to Nature: A Boat Trip to Remember\n\nIn the last summer vacation, I was staying at my village home. Some of my friends proposed that we should go on a journey by boat. We fixed a date and a destination. We hired a boat for the day. We set out early in the morning and enjoyed the tranquil river, as the sunrise created a golden hue on the water. Along the way, we were mėsmerized by the breathtaking sights of small villages, children waving and shouting 'hello', fishermen casting their nets, and women washing clothes in the river. We felt grateful to experience it together and enjoy nature's offerings. Around 11 a.m., we arrived at our destination, a small island in the middle of the river covered in lush greenery. We spent the next few hours exploring the island walking on foot, swimming in the river, and enjoying a pleasant picnic with the packed lunch we brought with us. Eventually, we set out for the return journey, which was equally enjoyable. We listened to the gentle murmur of the water and played a lively game of \"antakshari\" on the boat Reflecting on that day, I realized how much nature has to offer and how little we appreciate it. The journey helped me appreciate the simple things in life and reminded me that happiness can be found in the smallest moments. Most importantly, it taught me the beauty of living in the present moment and embracing the journey rather than just focusing on the destination.",
        "explanation": "The correct completion adds at least ten sentences that continue the events in a logical sequence, show what the characters do and feel, include enough detail about the journey and setting, and bring the episode to a clear outcome. This is right because a longer, coherent continuation provides cause-and-effect (what leads to each event), builds interest with specific actions or incidents, and gives the reader closure. In short, coherence, concrete details, character reaction, and a satisfying resolution are the essential elements that make the extended story complete and meaningful.",

So, the boy with the help of a passer-by brought the woman on the footpath. Then he called a rickshaw and took the woman to a nearby hospital. There the doctors at once examined the old woman and assured the boy that the condition of the woman was not serious and after first aid the old woman regained her sense. Now, Ahsanullah inquired of her whereabouts and she told him that she had come to this town from a nearby village to beg. But having heard a very loud sound of truck-horn, she was at a loss and lost her sense. After hearing this, the boy took the woman to his house and gave her good foods to eat. His mother also gave the woman some old clothes. On the boy's request, his mother also gave the woman some money to go back to the village.

        "solution": "The Farmer and the Nobleman\n\nOne day, a farmer was taking some sacks of wheat to a mill. The mill was a few kilometers away. On the way, the horse stumbled and one of the sacks fell onto the ground. It was too heavy for the farmer to lift and there was nobody around to help him. He was at a loss. Meanwhile, he saw a horseman coming towards him. His heart jumped. As the rider was coming nearer, the farmer recognized him. He was the nobleman who lived in a big house at the top of the hill. The farmer thought that it was not proper for him to seek help from the person of a high rank. So, he dared not approach the rider. The nobleman was very generous. He stopped in front of the farmer and got down from the horse and came forward to help the farmer willingly. Then he held one end of the sack and asked the farmer to hold the other end. Together they lifted the sack and placed it once again on the horse's back. The farmer took off his cap and wanted to offer thanks to the nobleman. But the nobleman took it as a humanitarian duty and suggested him do the same in others' distress.",
        "explanation": "The chosen ending is correct because it follows the story's setup: the fallen sack creates a clear problem that the farmer must deal with, and the ending shows a plausible reaction (repairing the sack, seeking help, or learning a lesson). This demonstrates narrative coherence—events progress logically from cause to effect and characters behave believably. For students, the key concept is to maintain consistent motivation, clear consequences, and a satisfying resolution so the story feels complete and meaningful.",

        "solution": "The king of Iran used to invite the great poet Sheikh Saadi very often to his court. Once on his way to the king's court the poet took shelter in a noble man's house for a night. He then took shelter in a nobleman's house for a night. He was then in a very simple dress. The nobleman could not recognize him and treated him as an ordinary man because he was not wearing the costly and gorgeous dress. He was wearing a very ordinary and cheap cloth. The treatment he received in the rich man's house offended him. But he did not say anything to him. On the next day, Sheikh Saadi went to the court of the king and was received with honour. He stayed there for a few days. He composed some beautiful poems and entertained the king and his courtiers. He received rich gifts from the king. He put on a very rich and ornamented dress. Thus, he was returning to his village. On his way, he again visited that rich man's house. This time, the rich man was surprised to see Sheikh Saadi in a rich ornamented dress. He was delighted to see the change in Sheikh Saadi and treated him with the best of the foods and comfort.\n\nWhile eating, he was surprised to see the rich delicious food and understood the rich man's attitude. Sheikh Saadi then instead of eating the food, started putting them into the pockets of his rich cloth. This surprised the rich man. \"Why are you putting the food into the pockets of your dress?\" said the rich man. \"I am putting them into the pockets of my dress because these foods are meant for my dress, not for me\", said Saadi. The rich man realized his earlier folly and became ashamed.",

He continued his search for water in order to save his life. At last he saw a jar at a distance and flew down to it. There was a little water at the bottom of the jar but it was too low for the crow. The crow tried to upset the jar but he was not strong enough to do it. The crow was in a fix what to do. But he did not lose heart. He tried to overtum the jar but failed. He was about to fly away when he saw some stones a little away from the jar. At once he hit upon a plan. He picked up the stones one by one and dropped them into the jar. When he dropped a large number of stones, the water in the jar rose high enough for him to reach it. Then the crow quenched its thirst drinking water to his heart's content.\n\nSelected Vocabulary (নির্বাচিত শব্দার্থ): One day-একদিন। crow-কাক, thirsty-তৃষ্ণার্ত, পিপাসার্ক in search of-c continue-চালিয়ে যাওয়া। in order to-উদ্দেশ্যে। save-রক্ষা করা; at last-অবশেষে, শেষে। jar-কলস; at a distance at the bottom-তলদেশে: low-নি: upset- উল্টানো, strong-শক্তিশালী, enough-যথেষ্ট। fail-বার্থ হওয়া। fly away-উড়ে যাওয়া: stone-পাথর। little away-একটু দূরে। at once-তৎক্ষণাৎ hit upon a plan-পরিকল্পনা করা, বুদ্ধি আটা, pick up-উঠানো, drop-ফেলা a large number of -বহু সংখ্যক; enough-যথেষ্ট। reach-পৌছানো। quench-নিবারণ করা, মেটানো। thirst-পিপাসা। heart's content-তৃপ্তি সহকারে। kose heart-হতাশ হওয়া।",

        "explanation": "The cry of “Fire! Fire! Help! Help!” in a crowded factory would naturally trigger panic and a quick attempt to escape, so workers would rush toward the exits.

He continued his search for water in order to save his life. At last he saw a jar at a distance and flew down to it. There was a little water at the bottom of the jar but it was too low for the crow. The crow tried to upset the jar but he was not strong enough to do it. The crow was in a fix what to do. But he did not lose heart. He tried to overtum the jar but failed. He was about to fly away when he saw some stones a little away from the jar. At once he hit upon a plan. He picked up the stones one by one and dropped them into the jar. When he dropped a large number of stones, the water in the jar rose high enough for him to reach it.

        "solution": "[math]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/math] Look before You LeapRafi is a worker of a big factory in Dhaka. There are more than 500 workers in the factory. One day while he was working, a loud sound was heard. Fire! Fire! Help! Help! As ill news runs apace, the news spread very fast among the workers. But no one noticed whether there was actually any fire or not. Having just heard the news, without any confirmation, all the workers of the factory became desperate to come outside.But the factory had only one exit and the path which led to this gate was very narrow. Even three men or women could not pass through this path side by side at a time. So, when all the workers of the factory were trying to come out along this narrow path, the path became congested with the workers. Many workers feli down on the path because of the jostling in the crowd and were trampled by other workers. Some of them received severe injuries. In a word, a chaotic situation had been prevailing in the factory. After observing the situation, the authority of the factory took steps to pacify the workers. The authority announced through loud speaker that the news was a rumour and no fire had broken out. Actually, a pipe containing colour had burst out in the dying section but it caused no casualties. After hearing this announcement twice, the workers understood their follies and went back to their work.Word Meaning: ill news (phr) - খারাপ সংবাদ; runs apace (phr) - দ্রুত ছড়ানো; confirmation (n) - নিশ্চিতকরণ; desperate (adj) – মরিয়া; exit (n) - প্রস্থান; narrow (adj) - সর; congested (adj) -জনাকীর্ণ; jostle (v) ধাজ্ঞাধাজি কর trample (v) - পদদলিত করা; chaotic situation (phr) - বিশৃঙ্খল অবস্থা; pacify (v) - শান্ত করা; announce (v) - যোবলা দেওয়া; rumour (n) – গুজব; burst out (v)- বিস্ফোরিত হওয়া; casualty (n) - ক্ষয়ক্ষতি/দুর্ঘটনা।",

He had to maintain his family consisting of eight members with great ditficulty. One day while walking through the fields, he found a purse dropped by a passer-by. He picked the purse up and found a lot of money in it. He said, \"It might be dropped by a passer-by.\" He looked for the owner for sometimes, but found no one. He took the bag to his home and showed it to his wife. His wife said to him, \"God has given this money to us and so we should use it to remove our poor condition.\" The rickshaw puller said, \"No, it does not belong to us. I should look for the owner.\" The next day, the rickshaw puller was waiting in that place where he found the purse thinking that the owner might come in search of it.

        "solution": "[math]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/math] King Midas: The Golden TouchOnce upon a time, there was a king called Midas. He was very rich. Yet he always longed for more riches. Moreover, he was fond of gold though he had a lot of it. He thought if he had the golden touch, he would be the happiest man. A wise God granted his wish promptly. One morning, he got up early and started walking around in his garden as usual and touched a white rose in the garden. Then he saw, to his utter surprise, that the flower had turned into a piece of white gold. He was amazed and touched another plant which, in an instant, turned into gold. It was really amusing to him. He started playing with his new found blessing. Right at this moment, his only daughter entered the garden. When he embraced his daughter to share his delight with her, to his sheer grief, he found her being turned into a statue of gold. He became very shocked at this and prayed to God to take back the destructive blessing. After few moments, the girl came to life. The king became happy.Word Meaning: Word Meaning: long (v) আকাঙ্ক্ষা করা; grant (v) প্রদান করা/মঞ্জুর করা; promptly (adv) - তক্ষুণি/শীঘ্র; utter surprise (phr) হতবাক; in an instant (adv) এক মুহূর্তেই; embrace (v) আলিঙ্গন করা; delight (n) - আনন্দ; sheer grief (phr) - নিদারুণ শোক; statue (n) মূর্তি; destructive (adj) ধ্বাংসাত্মক।",
        "explanation": "The correct ending has Midas’s touch turning everything to gold and then his regret because it logically follows his established love of wealth and creates a clear cause‑and‑effect conflict. This illustrates the underlying concept that excessive greed brings harm and leads to a moral lesson when the character realizes what truly matters.",

        "solution": "Completed story with meaning:\n\nOne day à crow became very thirsty. He flew from one place to another in search of water. But be found no water. He continued his search for water in order to save his life. At last he saw a jar at a distance and flew down to it. There was a little water at the bottom of the jar but it was too low for the crow. The crow tried to upset the jar but he was not strong enough to do it. The crow was in a fix what to do. But he did not lose heart. He tried to overtum the jar but failed. He was about to fly away when he saw some stones a little away from the jar. At once he hit upon a plan. He picked up the stones one by one and dropped them into the jar. When he dropped a large number of stones, the water in the jar rose high enough for him to reach it. Then the crow quenched its thirst drinking water to his heart's content.\n\nSelected Vocabulary (নির্বাচিত শব্দার্থ): One day-একদিন। crow-কাক, thirsty-তৃষ্ণার্ত, পিপাসার্ক in search of-c continue-চালিয়ে যাওয়া। in order to-উদ্দেশ্যে। save-রক্ষা করা; at last-অবশেষে, শেষে। jar-কলস; at a distance at the bottom-তলদেশে: low-নি: upset- উল্টানো, strong-শক্তিশালী, enough-যথেষ্ট। fail-বার্থ হওয়া। fly away-উড়ে যাওয়া: stone-পাথর। little away-একটু দূরে। at once-তৎক্ষণাৎ hit upon a plan-পরিকল্পনা করা, বুদ্ধি আটা, pick up-উঠানো, drop-ফেলা a large number of -বহু সংখ্যক; enough-যথেষ্ট। reach-পৌছানো। quench-নিবারণ করা, মেটানো। thirst-পিপাসা। heart's content-তৃপ্তি সহকারে। kose heart-হতাশ হওয়া।",
        "explanation": "ব্যাখ্যা: কাহিনীর শেষভাগে কাকটি একটি পাত্রে খুব সামান্য পানি খুঁজে পায় এবং ছোট ছোট পাথর পাত্রে ফেলে পানির سطح উপরে তুলতে পারে, ফলে সে পানি পান করে তৃষ্ণা মেটায়। এটি সঠিক কারণ পাথর ফেলার ফলে জলের বিস্তার ঘটে ও পানির স্তর ওঠে — কাকের বুদ্ধিমত্তা ও সমস্যার যৌক্তিক সমাধানের উদাহরণ।",

His wife Jarina, a greedy woman, was overwhelmed with joy, She asked her husband to hide the money so that nobody could see or know about it. But her husband began to think as to who might be the owner of the treasure. He remembered the house where he dropped his last pasfenger. He also found a card in which the name and address of the owner was written. He covered the bag with a cloth and set out for the house with his rickshaw. He reached the house and told the gate man, I am the rickshaw puller who brought the owner of this house here about an hour ago. Please tell him I have good news for him\". The gatekeeper conveyed the message and Mr. Samad came out running within a moment. He gave him the bag. He found his money intact. Then he took him in his living room. He gave him some money and appointed him caretaker of his house at a monthly pay of taka 6,000. Thus everybody was happy and he was rewarded for his honesty.\n\nSelected Vocabulary (নির্বাচিত শব্দার্থ): Greedy-onat: inside-faatt: overwhelm-নিমজ্জিত করা/হওয়া; hide-শুকানো, so that-যাতে owner-মালিক: treasure-সম্পদ, remember- স্মরণ করা। drop-নামিয়ে দেওয়া take out-নেওয়া। portion-অংশ/ভাগ, refuse-অয়াবার করা: set out-যাত্রা শুরু করা: press-চাপ দেওয়া: gate keeper- গেট রক্ষক/দারোয়ান, convey-পৌছে দেওয়া come out-বেড়িয়ে আসা, intact-অক্ষত",

        "solution": "Completed story with meaning:\n\nOnce a school boy named Talha s returning from school. On the way to his home, he saw a boy of his age. The boy was working in a workshop. His body was covered with dirt, oil and other chemicals. Talha became curious about the boy. He asked the boy why he was working here. The boy with eyes full of fears told that his father is no more and his mother works as a maid-servant in different houses. She earned very little and with the income it is difficult for us to have a square meal let alone to go to school. I work here for a long time. Talha became sad and went home. He knew a night school teacher. He went to him and told about the boy whose name was Mamun. The teacher took all the initiatives to make the boy study in the night school besides working in the workshop. Thus an unprivileged boy got the chance to study and make a better life.",
        "explanation": "A good ending works because it answers Talha’s question, gives believable reasons for the other boy’s situation, and shows how Talha reacts—this resolves the story’s initial curiosity and completes the narrative arc. The underlying concept is to develop cause (why the boy works), effect (how Talha feels and what he does), and a clear resolution or lesson (empathy, help, or change), so the reader feels satisfied. Keep details realistic and focused on character motives and a meaningful outcome to make the completion convincing and educational.",

He could hardly believe his eyes. Then whatever he touched, everything turned into gold. As he entered his palace, his little daughter ran up to him and he took her in his arms.

        "solution": "The Justice of Qazi\n\nOr, A Just Ruler And a Brave Quazi\n\nGias Uddin Azam Shah was a great ruler (শাসক) of Bengal. He was very kind and just. He was fond of hunting. One day he went a hunting at a nearby jungle. He aimed (লক্ষ্য) at a fawn (ফন- হরিণশিশু) but his arrow did not hit the target and it pierced (বিদ্ধ করল) a boy who was standing at the jungle. The boy instantly died. Unfortunately, the boy was the only son of a widow (বিধবা). The widow shocked very much. She went to the Quazi and prayed for justice. The Quazi was a strict judge of that time.\n\nHe summoned (নিমন্ত্রিত/ডেকে পাঠান)) the ruler to appear (উপস্থিত হওয়া/হাজির হওয়া) before him. The Quazi was determined to ensure justice. However, Gias Uddin Azam Shah appeared before the court of the Quazi and admitted his guilt (দোষ). The Quazi ordered him to pay full compensation (ক্ষতিপূরণ) to the widow. Gias Uddin paid the fine according to the verdict (বিচারের রায়). Then ruler showed his sword (তরবারি) to the Quazi and said, \"If you failed to carry out your duties as a judge out of fear of me, I would have punished you with this sword.\" Then the Quazi showed his cane (বেত) to the ruler and said, \"If you disobeyed (অমান্য করা) my verdict. I would punish you with this cane.\" The ruler was became ever friends.",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is that he spared the fawn because the passage describes him as kind and just; his compassion overrode his love of hunting. This shows how an author's description of a character’s traits lets readers infer how they would act in a situation, so his behavior matches the moral qualities given.",

He picked the purse up and found a lot of money in it. He said, \"It might be dropped by a passer-by.\" He looked for the owner for sometimes, but found no one. He took the bag to his home and showed it to his wife. His wife said to him, \"God has given this money to us and so we should use it to remove our poor condition.\" The rickshaw puller said, \"No, it does not belong to us. I should look for the owner.\" The next day, the rickshaw puller was waiting in that place where he found the purse thinking that the owner might come in search of it. After a long time, he noticed a man looking for something. The rickshaw puller rushed to the man and came to know that the purse belonged to him. He took the man to his home and handed over the bag. The man was very pleased at the honesty of the rickshaw puller. The man was very rich and he gave the rickshaw puller a good job with high salary in his farm.
