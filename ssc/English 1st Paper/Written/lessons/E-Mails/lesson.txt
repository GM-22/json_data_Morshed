You have wanted to know about my progress of studies. It seems that you're very worried about the coming examination. Don't worry, friend. You will be happy to know that I have already gone through all my subjects. My preparation of Bangla, English, General Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Religious Study is fairly well. Still, I have some problems in Higher Math. However, I will overcome them with the help of my teacher. I am now solving the test papers with great confidence. I contact with my teachers whenever any problem arises. My English teacher is very happy with my progress in English. I hope, your progress is also good.\n\nNo more today. Convey my best regard to your parents.\n\nYours ever,\n\nBristy",

But I have heard that you are not keeping good company around you. It is, indeed, a bad news for me.\n\nIn your last annual exam, you did not perform well. Your marks were visibly poor. I believe the main reason for this demotion is the bad company you are keeping. The people you are having around these days áre not attentive to studies. Studying hard and gaining knowledge are not their concerns. Also, some of them are heavily addicted to smoking. Some of them do not go to school regularly. If you continue mixing with them, it will affect your studies further. You will also develop bad habits like smoking, bunking off classes, being irregular in the classes, etc. So, I would request you to stay away from evil company. No more today. Keep in touch.\n\nYour loving sister,\n\nAbida",

        "solution": "To : sagor-bd@gmail.com\n\nSubject : The causes and effects of road accidents\n\nMy dear Sagor,\n\nThank you for your message. Today, I like to share my concern about frequent road accidents. Road accident has become a daily occurrence in our country. The real causes of road accidents lie with the people and not with the mechanised means of transport. Reckless driving and overtaking tendency of the drivers are responsible for most of the accidents. Sometimes, they lose control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rules by both the pedestrians and the drivers also causes road accidents. In some cities, roads are too narrow and inadequate. These can hardly cope with the ever-increasing volume of traffic. Every year, thousands of people die and many more get injured in road accidents. Sometimes, the injured have to embrace disability forever.\n\nRoad accidents have become a great menace in our society. Stern steps must be taken to check this danger. Spacious roads should be constructed and traffic signals should be set up at the key points. Heavy penalty should be imposed on those who violate the traffic rules. Moreover, common people should be made aware of the traffic rules through radio, television, newspapers and posters.\n\nOk, I will be longing for your further text.\n\nYour friend,\n\nSabuj",

It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that \"A sound mind remains in a sound body.\" So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. You are already suffering from leg pain. Still you are not taking any sort of physical exercise. If you avoid doing exercise on a regular basis, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will be inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. You must have a proper guideline for this. I think, you will inform me your details soon. How're our parents? Convey my best wishes to Tuhin and Shaon. No more today.\n\nYour elder sister,\n\nRubina",

Hope, you all are keeping in good health by the grace of the Almighty. I am doing fine, too. I know you are very curious to know about my hostel life. Our hostel is a two-storied building within our school compound. A flower garden in front of the building makes it more beautiful. Academic atmosphere in the hostel is very good. Strict discipline is maintained in our hostel. The hostel superintendent looks after the administration and academic affairs properly. He loves the studerits very much. Everyone here is friendly and co-operative. We exchange our views regarding many affairs. There is a prayer room in the compound where we perform our religious duty regularly. The meals are delicious and healthy, too. After all, this hostel is treating me quite nicely. This is all for now. With best regards.\n\nYour loving daughter,\n\nTanha",
