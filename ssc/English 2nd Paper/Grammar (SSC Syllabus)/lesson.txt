        "explanation": "Explanation: Each sentence is made by combining a subject from the left column, an appropriate verb from the middle column, and a complement from the right column so that both grammar and meaning fit (subject–verb agreement and correct verb collocation). For example, \"Wildlife refers to all animals, plants found in the forests\" uses \"refers to\" to define the subject; \"Balance of ecosystem largely depends on wildlife\" uses \"depends on\" with \"on wildlife\"; and \"Urbanization and industrialization have also increased deforestation to a great extent\" uses a plural subject with \"have also increased\" taking \"deforestation…\" as its object. This matching ensures each sentence is grammatically correct and semantically logical.",

        "explanation": "(a) dangerous — \"effects\" needs an adjective, so \"dangerous\" describes harmful effects.  \n(b) economic — \"loss\" takes the adjective \"economic\" (not \"economical\").  \n(c) addiction — \"a kind of\" requires a noun, so the noun \"addiction\" fits.  \n(d) addicted — after \"become\" we use the past participle \"addicted\" (to drugs).  \n(e) awareness — we \"raise awareness\" (noun) among people.  \n(f) discourage — to stop others we \"discourage\" them (verb formed with dis-).  \n(g) impossible — the opposite of \"possible\" is needed: \"It is impossible to stop...\"  \n(h) united — \"efforts\" is modified by the adjective \"united.\"  \n(i) unfortunately — a sentence adverb is required, so \"unfortunately\" fits.  \n(j) unwise — those who do foolish things are \"unwise\" (adjective).",

        "explanation": "Explanation: Use the correct word-forms (adjective, noun or adverb) made by adding suitable prefixes/suffixes to fit the grammar and meaning. For example, \"riverine\" and \"agricultural\" are adjectives describing the country, and \"majority\" is the noun meaning most people. Negative ideas use the prefix \"un-\" or \"dis-\" as in \"unfortunately,\" \"unsatisfactory,\" and \"disadvantages\"; adverbs take \"-ly\" (e.g., \"hardly,\" \"properly,\" \"gradually\"). Other common suffixes produce adjectives or nouns: \"financial,\" \"technological,\" \"government\" (from govern + -ment), \"conventional,\" and \"effective,\" which all match the roles required in the sentences.",

This huge population needs more shelter, (d)---- (agriculture) land, fuel and furniture etc. For all these reasons, people cut trees. Moreover, there are (e)---- (honest) people who cut trees for making money (f)----- (legally). The (g)---- (remove) of trees causes serious damage to the soil as trees give (h)---- (protect) to soil as well. The temperature will rise and it will cause green house effect.

        "solution": "(a) Deforestation; (b) indiscriminately; (c) densely; (d) agricultural; (e) dishonest; (f) illegally; (g) removal; (h) protection; (i) unsuitable; (j) plantation.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: Choose words that fit both meaning and grammatical form. Thus (a) \"deforestation\" is the noun for cutting down trees; (b) \"indiscriminately\" and (f) \"illegally\" are adverbs describing how trees are cut; (c) \"densely\" modifies \"populated\", while (d) \"agricultural\" and (j) \"planting\" are the correct adjective/noun forms for \"land\" and \"programme\" respectively. (e) \"dishonest\" is the opposite of \"honest\"; (g) \"removal\" and (h) \"protection\" are noun forms of \"remove\"/\"protect\"; and (i) \"unsuitable\" is the negative adjective needed.",

        "question": "Sohel asked Alam Friend have you ever visited the National Memorial at Savar in Dhaka Wow how Splendid it is Yes I havent yet gone there said Alam.",
        "solution": "Sohel asked Alam, \"Friend, have you ever visited The National Memorial at Savar in Dhaka? Wow! How splendid it is!\" \"Yes. I haven't yet gone there,\" said Alam.\n\n[Note: As there is a negative sentence after yes, yes is considered as a sentence.]",
        "explanation": "The correct version uses quotation marks and appropriate punctuation because Sohel's words are a question (\"Have you ever visited...?\"), the reaction is an exclamation (\"How splendid it is!\"), and Alam's reply is a negative statement with the present perfect to show experience up to now (\"I haven't yet gone there.\"). Using these forms and punctuation makes the meaning clear and fits the rules for direct speech and tense (present perfect for past experience).",

        "explanation": "His constant curiosity made him observe problems, ask questions, and try many experiments, which led to useful inventions—this is why calling Edison a great scientist is correct. Curiosity is the key trait for inventors because it motivates investigation, repeated testing, and learning from failures until a solution is found.",

Then Mona told her mother that she had to buy her (Mona) a good doll. Mother agreed with her.",
        "explanation": "The correct indirect-speech version uses backshifting of tenses, changes exclamations to \"exclaimed\" or \"said\" and shifts time/place words (e.g., \"tomorrow\" → \"the next day\"). For example, Mona’s “How lovely the doll is! I’ll buy it,” becomes Mona exclaimed that the doll was lovely and that she would buy it; Mother’s “Tomorrow we’ll visit another village fair” becomes she said they would visit the next day and urged them to go then. Imperatives like “Let’s go now” become suggestions or urgings (she told them to go), and direct requests like “You must buy me a good doll” become Mona insisted that her mother must/should buy her a good doll, with the short reply “Yes” reported as agreement.",

The guardian said that they, all the guardians along with him (H) had to do something for the betterment of their children. He (g) also said that they were losing their morality. The headmaster suggested that they should plan something for their betterment.",
        "explanation": "When converting to reported speech we shift tense and change forms: a question like “May I come in?” becomes the guardian asking if he [math]might[/math] come in (because [math]may[/math] → [math]might[/math] in indirect speech), and an imperative like “Yes, come in, please” becomes the headmaster telling him to come in (imperative → told/requested + to‑infinitive). The guardian’s remark about guardians doing something is reported as him saying that all the guardians, along with the headmaster, must do something for the children’s betterment and that the children were losing their morality (present progressive → past progressive). “Let’s plan something” is reported as the headmaster suggesting that they plan (or should plan) something.",

        "question": "“Konika, have you done your English lesson today?” asked the teacher. “Yes, sir,” she replied. “But I have not understood one gramatical point.” The teacher assured her saying, “Come to my room. I will help you understand the point.” “Thank you, sir,” she smilingly said.",

The teacher assured her telling her to go to his room. He again said that he would help her understand the point. She smilingly thanked him respectfully.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: The word \"gramatical\" is a spelling error; it should be \"grammatical.\" \"Smilingly\" is not a standard adverb in this context; use the participial form or phrase—e.g. \"she said, smiling\" or \"she said with a smile.\" Also place a comma before the participial phrase (\"The teacher assured her, saying…\") to separate it from the main clause.",

        "solution": "The manager wished the lady good morning and asked her if he could help her. The lady replied in the affirmative and said that she had been told to go over there to get a parking sticker. Out of curiosity, she again asked the manager if that was the right place. Then the manager replied in the affirmative and said that it was the right place and at the same time asked the lady what the registration number of her car was.",
        "explanation": "In reported speech, direct questions use “asked if/whether” and verbs shift back in time (for example, “can” → “could”, “is” → “was”, “was told” → “had been told”) and pronouns are changed as needed. So the correct indirect version uses these changes: the manager asked if he could help, the lady said she had been told to come for a parking sticker and asked if that was the right place, and the manager replied that it was and asked what the registration number of her car was.",

She added that she had lost her copy the day before yesterday. Then I told her that I could lend her, and also told her to return it in a week.",
        "explanation": "Use \"I can lend it to you\" because \"lend\" normally takes a thing as a direct object; if you don’t name the thing you must say \"it\" (or include the object, e.g. \"I can lend you my copy\"). The book title should be marked (e.g. 'A Practical English Grammar') and the author is introduced with \"by\" rather than \"of\". In direct speech, when a sentence is followed by a reporting tag (like \"said Oishe\" or \"I said\"), replace the final full stop with a comma inside the closing quote: \"I can lend it to you, but return it in a week,\" I said.",

        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation: The correct words follow basic grammar patterns — \"essential\" takes the preposition \"for\" (a), \"expect\" is followed by the infinitive \"to\" (b), and a singular noun phrase needs the article \"a\" before \"complete sense\" (c). \"In case of\" (d) is the fixed phrase, \"what is\" (e) introduces the object clause the student will miss, and \"written\" (f) parallels \"edited\" as past participles describing textbooks. After verbs like \"ignore\" we use the gerund \"reading\" (g), \"relying on\" (h) is the correct phrasal verb, \"whereas\" (i) shows contrast, and \"of\" (j) indicates the relationship/possession (\"flourish of a student\").",

        "solution": "Completing Sentences:\n\n(a) \"Industry is the key to success\" is a saying. (\"পরিশ্রম সফলতার চাবিকাঠি\" একটি প্রবাদ।)\n\n(b) If you want to shine in life, you have to work hard. (তুমি যদি জীবনে উন্নতি লাভ করতে চাও তবে তোমাকে কঠোর পরিশ্রম করতে হবে।)\n\n(c) By working hard, one can prosper in life.

This sentence states a general truth that hard work (industry) leads to success.\n\n(b) If you want to shine in life, you must work hard. \"Shine\" here means succeed or stand out, and effort is the means to achieve that.\n\n(c) By working hard, one can achieve success. Hard work produces results, so effort leads to accomplishment.\n\n(d) A hardworking student is sure to succeed. Regular effort improves understanding and results, making success likely.\n\n(e) It is high time for us to take action. \"High time\" implies urgency, so we must start doing something now rather than delaying.",

        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "(a) Unless you study attentively, you will fail the exam.  \nExplanation: \"Unless\" means \"if not\", so the sentence is a negative conditional: a future result (will fail) follows the negative condition (not studying attentively).\n\n(b) It is a long time since I last saw you.  \nExplanation: \"Since\" links to a past event; this construction (“It is a long time since …”) refers to a past point and implies the present perfect idea (I have not seen you for a long time).\n\n(c) If I had seen you, I would have spoken to you.  \nExplanation: This is the third (past unreal) conditional: past perfect in the if-clause + \"would have\" + past participle in the main clause to show an unreal past result.\n\n(d) 1971 is the year when Bangladesh became independent.  \nExplanation: \"The year when\" introduces a time-defining relative clause; a past simple verb is used for a historical fact.\n\n(e) Danger comes where there is carelessness.  \nExplanation: \"Where\" here means \"in situations in which\"; the present simple states a general truth about cause and effect.",

Explanation: \"After\" is followed by a clause; for future sequences English uses the present simple in the subordinate clause (\"he finishes\") to show the action happens first.\n\n(c) A graveyard is the place where dead people are buried. Explanation: \"Where\" introduces a location clause that defines what the place is used for.\n\n(d) What is written cannot be blotted. Explanation: \"What\" forms a noun clause meaning \"the things that are written,\" and that whole clause is the subject of the sentence.\n\n(e) The answer that he gave was correct.

        "explanation": "Explanation:\n\n(a) The mango is a fruit which is rich in vitamins. — \"which\" introduces a relative clause giving more information about \"fruit.\"\n\n(b) It is so delicious that everyone likes it. — \"so ... that\" expresses a result; \"that\" introduces the result clause (everyone likes it).\n\n(c) Rajshahi is the place where many mangoes are grown. — \"where\" links the noun \"place\" to a clause describing what happens in that place (in which many mangoes are grown).\n\n(d) If you visit Rajshahi, Bogura and Dinajpur, you will see large mango orchards. — A real conditional: present tense in the \"if\" clause plus \"will\" in the main clause shows a likely future result.\n\n(e) People of this area produce a huge amount of mangoes and export them. — \"and\" connects two related actions (producing and exporting) to complete the idea.",

        "explanation": "(a) The correct completion is a proverb about early rising and disciplined habits: it says that regular, orderly routines (like rising early) promote health, efficiency and success. This is right because habits formed by discipline produce better physical and mental results over time.\n\n(b) The right idea is that a young mind is pliable and easily shaped by teaching and example. That’s why education and good influence in youth have a lasting effect on character and behaviour.\n\n(c) The sentence means that once the early, most productive years are wasted they cannot be recovered. It’s correct because time is irreversible, so losing youthful opportunities reduces future potential.\n\n(d) This completes the cause–effect idea: if we sow good work or habits, we will reap a good harvest (good results). It’s true because effort and wise choices tend to produce corresponding positive outcomes.\n\n(e) The contrast shows that laziness brings failure or loss of opportunities. This is right because inactivity and neglect prevent progress, so one cannot expect good results without effort.",

This completion shows purpose — the sentence needs a phrase explaining why people cut trees.\n\n(b) Trees cause rainfall which helps maintain soil moisture and supports agriculture. The relative clause introduced by \"which\" should describe the beneficial effect of that rainfall.\n\n(c) If we cut trees at random, soil erosion and floods will increase. This is a cause–effect conditional: removing trees causes loss of root binding, so erosion and flooding follow.\n\n(d) Trees supply oxygen essential for human and animal life. This states a factual result of photosynthesis, so the completion should name the life-supporting role of oxygen.\n\n(e) Since trees help us in many ways, we must protect and plant more of them.

        "explanation": "(a) We must work hard in order that we may succeed.\nExplanation: \"In order that\" expresses purpose and is followed by a clause showing the intended result; \"may succeed\" correctly shows the goal of working hard.\n\n(b) A man who does not work hard cannot shine in life.\nExplanation: The relative clause \"who does not work hard\" defines the kind of man, and the negative shows the consequence that he cannot succeed or \"shine.\"\n\n(c) It is hard labour that brings success.\nExplanation: This cleft sentence (\"It is ... that\") emphasizes the cause; it shows that hard labour is the key factor producing success.\n\n(d) The idle cannot reach their target because they do not work hard.\nExplanation: \"Because\" gives the reason — idleness (not working hard) is the cause of failing to reach targets.\n\n(e) Nothing can be achieved unless you work hard.\nExplanation: \"Unless\" means \"if not,\" so this conditional states that without hard work, achievement is impossible.",

(সবাই সরলতা পছন্দ করুক।)\n\n(j) So, all should lead a simple life. (তাই, সকলের উচিত সরল জীবনযাপন করা।)",
        "explanation": "(a) What a great virtue simplicity is!\nExplanation: Exclamatory sentences use \"What\" (noun phrase + subject + verb) to express strong feeling; here the structure emphasizes the praise of simplicity.\n\n(b) Nobody fails to appreciate this quality.\nExplanation: To convert to a negative without changing the meaning, use \"nobody fails to…\" which keeps the original affirmative sense that all appreciate it.\n\n(c) It is a very good quality.\nExplanation: Changing from superlative (\"one of the best\") to the positive degree removes comparison; \"very good\" gives the plain positive form.\n\n(d) This virtue should be practised.\nExplanation: Passive voice with a modal uses \"should be\" + past participle, so the object (\"this virtue\") becomes the subject of the passive sentence.\n\n(e) A simple man is happier than most men.\nExplanation: Comparative degree uses \"happier than\" to compare two groups; this conveys the same idea as \"very few men are as happy as…\".\n\n(f) By practising simplicity one cannot fail to earn people's favour.\nExplanation: Using \"cannot fail to\" is a negative form that preserves the original meaning (that practising simplicity will certainly earn favour).\n\n(g) What a very carefree life a simple man leads!\nExplanation: Exclamatory form with \"What\" + noun phrase + subject + verb expresses surprise or strong feeling about the carefree life.\n\n(h) A simple man is the happiest person among us.\nExplanation: Superlative uses \"the + adjective + noun\" to show the highest degree of happiness within the group.\n\n(i) Let everyone like simplicity.\nExplanation: Imperative for a general command or wish uses \"Let\" + object (everyone) + base verb to address all persons.\n\n(j) So, everyone should lead a simple life.\nExplanation: Active voice makes \"everyone\" the subject performing the action; it changes \"should be led by all\" into the corresponding active form.",

(Exclamatory)  \nWhen expressed with strong feeling or an exclamation intonation (or recast as \"What a very nice flower the rose is!\"), the sentence becomes exclamatory because it emphasizes admiration.\n\n(d) We should be patriots.

        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "(a) Because health is wealth, one should take care of it.\nExplanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate clause (\"Because health is wealth\") that gives a reason and a main clause (\"one should take care of it\").\n\n(b) A healthy poor man is not less happy than a sick moneyed man.\nExplanation: The positive degree uses the base adjective \"happy\"; adding \"not less\" expresses the same comparison without using the comparative form \"happier.\"\n\n(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family, but an unhealthy man is a liability.\nExplanation: This is a compound sentence formed by joining two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction \"but.\"\n\n(d) Can he succeed in life?\nExplanation: Forming an interrogative here requires inverting the auxiliary \"can\" and the subject \"he.\"\n\n(e) So, everybody must be conscious of his health.\nExplanation: \"Cannot but be conscious\" means \"must be conscious,\" so removing the negation yields the affirmative form.\n\n(f) Everybody must not neglect his health at any time.\nExplanation: A negative construction that preserves the original meaning uses \"must not neglect\" to show prohibition/avoidance.\n\n(g) Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet can improve health.\nExplanation: Changing to active voice makes the agents (\"regular physical exercise and a balanced diet\") the subject that performs the action on \"health.\"\n\n(h) People are poor. They cannot afford to take a balanced diet.\nExplanation: The relative clause (\"who are poor\") is split into a simple sentence about people’s condition and a separate simple sentence stating they cannot afford a balanced diet.\n\n(i) How concerned they are about the quantity of food!\nExplanation: An exclamatory sentence uses \"How\" + adjective to express strong feeling about their concern.\n\n(j) It should be known by everybody that weakness is caused by malnutrition.\nExplanation: The main clause is put into passive voice (\"It should be known by everybody\") and the fact is expressed passively (\"weakness is caused by malnutrition\").",

(Compound)\n\n(h) He was very kind to the poor: (Negative without changing meaning)\n\n(i)One day when a thief entered his room, he caught him. (Simple)\n\n(j)He caught the thief but did not punish him. (Complex)",
        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "(a) The original uses a comparative (\"more ... than any other\") which is equivalent to a superlative; to make the positive degree we use the base adjective with an intensifier (e.g. \"very gracious\"). This keeps the meaning but removes the comparative form.\n\n(b) A complex sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause; add a relative or adverbial clause for extra information (e.g. \"He was born in Hoogli, which is in Bengal\") to make it complex.\n\n(c) Past simple questions use the auxiliary \"did\" plus the base verb, so the interrogative form is \"Did he inherit a vast property from his father and sister?\" The main verb becomes the base form \"inherit\" and \"did\" marks the past.\n\n(d) Passive of a past simple negative uses \"was not\" + past participle: \"This wealth was not misused by him.\" The object becomes the subject and the agent is optional with \"by.\"\n\n(e) To change passive to active make the agent the subject: \"People call him a friend of humanity.\" The verb changes accordingly and the object becomes the direct object.\n\n(f) To express the same idea affirmatively without \"not,\" use an adjective: \"He remained unmarried.\" This affirmative form conveys the same meaning as \"He did not marry.\"\n\n(g) A compound sentence joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction; e.g. \"He spent money lavishly to help the poor, and people benefited greatly from his generosity.\" This preserves the original idea while adding a second independent clause.\n\n(h) Use the negative of an antonym to keep the meaning: \"He was not unkind to the poor.\" Saying \"not unkind\" expresses the same positive idea without the original phrasing.\n\n(i) A simple sentence has one subject and one predicate; combine the actions around a single subject: \"One day a thief entered his room and was caught.\" Here \"a thief\" is the single subject with a compound predicate, making the sentence simple.\n\n(j) Use a subordinating conjunction to form a complex sentence showing contrast: \"Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him.\" The subordinate clause (\"Although he caught the thief\") plus the main clause make it complex.",

        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "(a) \"Man is the best creation of God.\" → Comparative: change the superlative \"best\" to the comparative \"better\" and add a comparison, e.g. \"Man is better than other creations of God.\" This is because comparative degree (better) compares two or more items and uses \"than\" to show the comparison.\n\n(b) \"Isn’t it our responsibility to do good deeds?\" → Assertive: make it a statement: \"It is our responsibility to do good deeds.\" Turn the question into a declarative sentence by removing inversion and the negative auxiliary (\"Isn't\") and using the affirmative verb form.\n\n(c) \"Our life is not measured by months or years.\" → Active: make the agent the subject, e.g. \"Nobody measures our life by months or years.\" Passive \"is measured\" becomes active \"measures\" and you supply a subject (nobody/people) while keeping the negation.\n\n(d) \"Honest people lead a happy life.\" → Complex: add a subordinate clause to show reason or condition, e.g. \"Honest people lead a happy life because they have peace of mind.\" A complex sentence has one independent clause plus a dependent (subordinate) clause like \"because…\" to show cause or condition.\n\n(e) \"It matters little if a man lives many years or not.\" → Interrogative: form a question: \"Does it matter if a man lives many years or not?\" Turn the statement into a question by inserting the auxiliary \"does\" and inverting the subject and auxiliary.\n\n(f) \"Nobody is absolutely happy on earth.\" → Affirmative: express the same idea without a negative word, e.g. \"Everyone has some unhappiness on earth.\" To convert a negative sentence to an affirmative equivalent, replace the negative subject (\"nobody\") with a positive subject (\"everyone\") and rephrase the predicate to keep the original meaning.\n\n(g) \"So, we should not waste time in vain.\" → Passive: make \"time\" the subject, e.g. \"So, time should not be wasted in vain (by us).\" In passive voice the object of the active sentence becomes the subject, and the verb becomes a form of \"be\" + past participle; the agent (\"by us\") is optional.\n\n(h) \"If we use time properly, we can be benefited.\" → Simple: convert to a single independent clause, e.g. \"We can benefit by using time properly.\" A simple sentence has one independent clause, so combine the idea into one clause (using a gerund or rephrasing) and use active verb \"benefit.\"\n\n(i) \"All men must die.\" → Negative: put the statement in negative form, e.g. \"All men do not live forever.\" This negates the predicate (\"do not live forever\") while preserving the original sense that mortality is inevitable.\n\n(j) \"Though we take utmost care, we cannot avoid death.\" → Compound: join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction, e.g. \"We take utmost care, yet we cannot avoid death.\" A compound sentence links two independent clauses of equal rank using conjunctions like \"and,\" \"but,\" or \"yet.\"",

        "explanation": "(a) The sentence is a declarative (assertive) simple sentence because it states a fact: subject + verb + complement, with no question or command.  \n(b) This is a superlative (not comparative) declarative sentence because the word \"greatest\" shows the highest degree among all.  \n(c) The sentence is affirmative (positive) and declarative because it affirms an action; there is no negation word like \"not\" or \"never.\"  \n(d) This is a complex sentence: the main clause (\"This quality highly motivates a man\") is followed by a subordinate purpose clause (\"so that he can sacrifice his life for the country\").  \n(e) It is exclamatory because it expresses strong feeling using \"What ...!\" rather than making a plain statement.  \n(f) Grammatically this is a simple sentence with a participial phrase (\"having patriotic zeal\") modifying \"a man\"; it does not contain a separate clause, so it is not complex.  \n(g) The sentence is negative in meaning because \"none\" (no one) negates the verb—so it expresses negation rather than being purely affirmative.  \n(h) This is a simple sentence: a single independent clause with an introductory adverbial phrase (\"By paying taxes\"); it is not two independent clauses joined, so it is not compound.  \n(i) The sentence is passive voice because the subject (\"He\") receives the action (\"is respected\") rather than doing it; the active form would be \"All respect him.\"  \n(j) This is a declarative suggestion (modal statement) using \"should,\" not an imperative command; an imperative would be \"Be patriots.\"",

        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "(a) Facebook is not a common social network.\nExplanation: Form a negative by placing \"not\" after the verb \"is\" to negate the statement.\n\n(b) Now, people are using it all over the world.\nExplanation: Change passive to active by supplying a doer (\"people\") and using the active verb form (\"are using\").\n\n(c) Does everybody use it?\nExplanation: Make a present-simple question by adding the auxiliary \"does\" before the subject and using the base verb \"use.\"\n\n(d) Every student has a smart phone.\nExplanation: Convert the negative expression \"no student without\" into an affirmative universal statement using \"every\" and \"has.\"\n\n(e) Nobody dislikes social networks.\nExplanation: Change the interrogative \"Who does not...\" into a declarative by stating the negative in a simple affirmative clause (\"Nobody dislikes...\").\n\n(f) Facebook is good.\nExplanation: Replace the superlative \"the best\" with the positive (base) adjective \"good\" to express the positive degree.\n\n(g) It gives pleasure and restricts our freedom to use it.\nExplanation: Make a simple sentence by keeping one subject (\"It\") and giving it a compound predicate (\"gives... and restricts...\"), so only one independent clause remains.\n\n(h) If you do not use it, you cannot keep pace with the modern world.\nExplanation: Form a complex sentence by introducing a dependent conditional clause (\"If you do not use it\") and linking it to the main clause.\n\n(i) We can get many new pieces of information by using it, and we can share them with others.\nExplanation: Create a compound sentence by joining two independent clauses with \"and,\" each clause able to stand alone.\n\n(j) I wish I could open a Facebook account.\nExplanation: Turn the optative/exclamatory \"Would that I could...\" into an assertive declarative by using \"I wish...\" to state the same desire.",

        "explanation": "\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ea\u003C/span\u003E This expresses a superlative idea because it compares Taimur with almost all other conquerors (\"very few ... so great as\"), showing he stands at the highest degree of greatness.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eb\u003C/span\u003E Incorrect — the sentence is passive: the subject (\"The province\") receives the action and the agent appears after \"by\" (\"by young Taimur\"); the active form is \"Young Taimur once attacked the province of a powerful prince.\"\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ec\u003C/span\u003E Incorrect — this is complex, not compound: it has a main clause (\"he captured a large village\") and a dependent participial clause (\"Entering the kingdom of the prince\") that modifies it, so one independent plus one subordinate element.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ed\u003C/span\u003E Incorrect — the sentence is active because \"The army\" is the doer performing the action \"killed\"; the passive version would be \"All Taimur’s soldiers were killed by the army.\"\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ee\u003C/span\u003E Correct — it is complex: there is a main clause (\"He disguised himself as a poor traveler\") and a subordinate infinitive of purpose (\"to survive\"), so one independent clause plus a dependent purpose phrase.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ef\u003C/span\u003E Correct — it's a simple sentence with one subject (\"He\") and a compound predicate (\"came ... and asked\"), so a single independent clause describing two actions by the same subject.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eg\u003C/span\u003E Incorrect — this is simple, not complex: \"There lived an old woman in the house\" is a single independent clause (existential construction) with no subordinate clause.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eh\u003C/span\u003E Incorrect — the sentence is declarative, not interrogative: it states a fact (\"The woman became sympathetic...\") and does not ask a question; an interrogative would use question word/order or a question mark.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ei\u003C/span\u003E Incorrect — as written it is a declarative statement describing the food; an exclamatory sentence would show strong feeling or use exclamatory form (e.g., \"How hot the food was!\").\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ej\u003C/span\u003E Incorrect — the sentence uses the \"too ... to ...\" degree construction (affirmative) to show excess, not negation; a negative sentence would include \"not\" or another negative word.",

        "explanation": "(a) My friend invited me to pay a visit to Cox’s Bazar, which I gladly accepted.\nExplanation: This is a complex sentence because it joins a main clause with a relative clause \"which I gladly accepted,\" adding extra information about the invitation.\n\n(b) I was not very glad.\nExplanation: Adding \"not\" makes the sentence negative while keeping the same tense and subject.\n\n(c) The invitation was accepted by me.\nExplanation: Passive voice is formed by making the object (\"the invitation\") the subject and using the auxiliary \"was\" + past participle \"accepted.\"\n\n(d) My friend received me cordially.\nExplanation: This is a simple sentence with one independent clause expressing a single complete idea.\n\n(e) How excited I was to see the sea beach!\nExplanation: An exclamatory sentence uses \"How\" + adjective to express strong feeling or surprise.\n\n(f) It is a very large sea beach.\nExplanation: The positive degree uses the base adjective \"large\" (here strengthened by \"very\") instead of the superlative \"largest.\"\n\n(g) It is more beautiful than many other sea beaches in the world.\nExplanation: The comparative degree is formed with \"more\" + adjective and \"than\" to compare it with other beaches.\n\n(h) People call it the pleasure seekers’ paradise.\nExplanation: Active voice uses a clear subject (\"People\") performing the action (\"call\") on the object (\"it\").\n\n(i) Every year a lot of people come to visit it, and they enjoy the beach.\nExplanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses (\"a lot of people come...\" and \"they enjoy...\") with the coordinating conjunction \"and.\"\n\n(j) I wish I could visit the sea beach.\nExplanation: This assertive (declarative) sentence states the speaker’s wish directly instead of the exclamatory form.",

        "explanation": "(a) Is Mother Teresa an icon to many people?\nExplanation: The sentence is made interrogative by inverting the auxiliary verb \"is\" and the subject \"Mother Teresa\".\n\n(b) Everybody respects her.\nExplanation: Converted the passive \"is respected by everybody\" into active voice by making \"everybody\" the subject and \"respects\" the verb.\n\n(c) She is a great person.\nExplanation: Changed from the superlative phrase \"one of the greatest\" to the positive degree \"great\", which is the required positive form of the adjective.\n\n(d) She was not unkind to the needy and the ill-fated.\nExplanation: Made the sentence negative by adding \"not\" and using the opposite \"unkind\" (litotes) to preserve the original meaning.\n\n(e) She believes that charity is a great virtue, and others agree with her.\nExplanation: Formed a compound sentence by joining two independent clauses with the coordinating conjunction \"and\".\n\n(f) Mother Teresa was a noble-hearted person because she helped the poor.\nExplanation: Made it complex by adding the subordinate clause \"because she helped the poor,\" which provides a reason for the main clause.\n\n(g) What a passionate woman Mother Teresa was!\nExplanation: Converted to an exclamatory sentence using the \"What a...\" structure to express strong feeling.\n\n(h) She helped the helpless.\nExplanation: Simplified to a single independent clause by removing the relative clause, making it a simple sentence.\n\n(i) She set up \"Nirmal Hridoy\" in Kolkata, and it served the needy.\nExplanation: Created a compound sentence by joining two independent clauses with \"and\".\n\n(j) Everyone knows about Mother Teresa's charity.\nExplanation: Changed the interrogative into an assertive (declarative) sentence that states the fact directly.",

        "explanation": "(a) \"We are not grateful to the freedom fighters.\"  \nExplanation: This is the negative form of the affirmative sentence; adding \"not\" after the verb \"are\" makes the sentence negative.\n\n(b) \"No other thing is as great as their contribution.\"  \nExplanation: To change a superlative/comparative into the positive degree we use the structure \"as + adjective + as\"; this shows equality in positive form.\n\n(c) \"Some freedom fighters died in the Liberation War, and they are called martyrs.\"  \nExplanation: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses (\"Some freedom fighters died...\" and \"they are called martyrs\") with a coordinating conjunction \"and.\"\n\n(d) \"The National Memorial has been built so that people may pay tribute to their memories.\"  \nExplanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause and a subordinate purpose clause (\"so that...\") showing why the memorial was built.\n\n(e) \"A freedom fighter is greater than any other son of the soil.\"  \nExplanation: A comparative sentence uses \"greater than\" to compare one thing with others, replacing the superlative \"greatest.\"\n\n(f) \"They fought bravely and snatched the red sun of independence.\"  \nExplanation: This is a simple sentence with one subject \"They\" and a compound predicate (\"fought... and snatched...\"), so it remains simple.\n\n(g) \"What a passionate woman Mother Teresa was!\"  \nExplanation: An exclamatory sentence expresses strong feeling; beginning with \"What\" and reordering the clause makes it exclamatory.\n\n(h) \"Their weapons were ordinary, but they had much courage in their minds.\"  \nExplanation: Turning the subordinate contrast into two independent clauses joined by \"but\" makes it a compound sentence that shows contrast.\n\n(i) \"People will always remember their contribution.\"  \nExplanation: To make the sentence affirmative, remove the negation \"never\" and use a positive adverb \"always,\" here with an active subject \"People.\"\n\n(j) \"Some steps have been taken by the government to improve the condition.\"  \nExplanation: Converting the active sentence to passive makes the object \"some steps\" the subject and uses the correct tense form \"have been taken\" to match present perfect.",

        "explanation": "(a) We should read books because they help us gain knowledge.\nExplanation: Using \"because\" joins an independent clause and a subordinate clause, so the sentence becomes complex and shows reason.\n\n(b) We are introduced to the realm of knowledge by books.\nExplanation: The object \"us\" becomes the subject and the doer \"books\" is placed after \"by\", forming the passive voice.\n\n(c) Do the books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas?\nExplanation: For present simple questions we add the auxiliary \"do\" before the subject to form an interrogative sentence.\n\n(d) Reading books enriches our minds.\nExplanation: This is a single independent clause with a gerund subject, so it is a simple sentence expressing one complete idea.\n\n(e) Books are great friends.\nExplanation: Replacing the superlative \"greatest\" with the positive degree \"great\" produces the positive form.\n\n(f) They do not give us either knowledge or pleasure.\nExplanation: To make a negative of \"both ... and\" we use \"do not\" plus \"either ... or\" to negate the two items.\n\n(g) They are our real friends, and they remain with us in time of danger.\nExplanation: Two independent clauses are joined with the coordinating conjunction \"and,\" making the sentence compound.\n\n(h) How interesting some books are!\nExplanation: Using \"How\" + adjective + subject + verb forms an exclamatory sentence showing strong feeling.\n\n(i) If we read books, we can build up a developed society.\nExplanation: Beginning with \"if\" creates a subordinate (conditional) clause plus a main clause, so the sentence becomes complex.\n\n(j) Only books can remove the darkness of ignorance.\nExplanation: Replacing the negative phrase \"Nothing but\" with the affirmative limiter \"Only\" produces an affirmative sentence.",

        "explanation": "(a) Was there an old man in the village? — Change to a question by inverting the auxiliary verb \"was\" before the subject; \"There was...\" becomes \"Was there...?\" to form an interrogative.\n\n(b) Though he was very poor, he was honest. — This is complex because a subordinate clause (\"Though he was very poor\") is joined to the main clause to show contrast, so one clause depends on the other.\n\n(c) He was a good cap maker with palm leaves. — \"One of the best\" is a superlative; the positive degree replaces it with \"good\" to state the quality without comparison.\n\n(d) They were sold by him in the neighbouring market. — Passive voice makes the object (\"them\") the subject and uses the appropriate auxiliary + past participle, with the agent added by \"by him.\"\n\n(e) He earned money in this way, and thus he maintained his family. — Two independent clauses (\"He earned...\" and \"he maintained...\") are joined with the coordinating conjunction \"and,\" making a compound sentence.\n\n(f) One day he had to go to a market. — \"Could not but go\" is a negative idiom meaning necessity; the affirmative equivalent is \"had to go,\" keeping the same meaning in positive form.\n\n(g) The market was not near his house. — To make it negative, negate the statement by inserting \"not\" and restating the idea in opposite terms while keeping tense and subject.\n\n(h) He had a basket that was full of caps. — A relative clause (\"that was full of caps\") modifies \"basket,\" creating a complex sentence with a main clause plus a dependent clause.\n\n(i) He was too tired, so he could not walk. — Two related independent clauses expressing cause and effect are joined by \"so,\" forming a compound sentence.\n\n(j) He sat under the tree and fell asleep. — This is a simple sentence because it has one subject (\"He\") with a compound predicate (\"sat... and fell asleep\"), so it remains a single independent clause.",

        "explanation": "(a) The label “Comparative” is incorrect; the sentence uses the superlative phrase “most important,” so it is a superlative statement, not comparative—comparative would use “more important.”\n\n(b) The label “Active” is incorrect; “should not be elaborated” is passive voice (modal + past participle). An active form would be “You should not elaborate any answer.”\n\n(c) This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate adverbial clause “When he gets the question paper” plus the main clause “he should read it carefully,” so there are two clauses with a dependent–independent relationship.\n\n(d) The label “Negative” is wrong; the sentence is affirmative (positive) in meaning—“may seem difficult” expresses a possibility, not a negation.\n\n(e) The label “Complex” is incorrect; this is a simple sentence with one finite verb phrase “should attempt” and an infinitive phrase of purpose “to get good marks,” so it contains only one independent clause.\n\n(f) The label “Simple” is incorrect; this is a complex sentence because it begins with the conditional subordinate clause “If an examinee answers all the questions” followed by the main clause “the examiner becomes glad to see that.”\n\n(g) The label “Positive” is acceptable: the sentence is affirmative (not negative). Although it contains a comparative “better than,” it is a positive/affirmative statement rather than a negative one.\n\n(h) The label “Exclamatory” is incorrect; the sentence is a plain declarative statement (“It is really sensible”), not formed or punctuated as an exclamation.\n\n(i) The label “Passive” is incorrect; this is an active sentence with a modal verb (“should not waste”) where the subject “The examinee” performs the action—passive would be “Time should not be wasted by the examinee.”\n\n(j) The label “Compound” is incorrect; the sentence is simple: it has one independent clause “you cannot bring a good result in an examination” with a prepositional/participial phrase “Without following this process” serving as an adverbial modifier, not a second independent clause.",

The sentence states a fact; an interrogative would be formed as \"Did he inherit a vast property...?\" so the given form is not a question.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ed\u003C/span\u003E Correct classification: Active (negative). The subject \"He\" performs the action (\"did not misuse\"), so it is active voice with negation; the passive would be \"This wealth was not misused by him.\"\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ee\u003C/span\u003E Correct classification: Passive. \"He is called a friend of humanity\" shows the subject receiving the action (being called), so it is passive, not active.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ef\u003C/span\u003E Correct classification: Negative. \"He didn't marry\" contains negation (\"didn't\"), so it is a negative sentence; the affirmative form would be \"He married.\"\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eg\u003C/span\u003E Correct classification: Simple sentence. It contains one main clause with adverbials (\"During his life time, he spent...\") and no second independent clause, so it is not compound.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eh\u003C/span\u003E Correct classification: Affirmative. \"He was very kind to the poor\" affirms a quality and contains no negation, so it is affirmative, not negative.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ei\u003C/span\u003E Correct classification: Complex sentence. It has a main clause (\"a thief broke into his room\") plus a subordinate time clause (\"when he was saying his prayer\"), so it is complex.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ej\u003C/span\u003E Correct classification: Compound sentence. It joins two independent clauses (\"He caught the thief\" and \"didn’t punish him\") with the conjunction \"but,\" so it is compound rather than complex.",

        "solution": "(a) Everybody wants to succeed in life.\n\nOr, There is nobody but wants to succeed in life.\n\n(b) It is a difficult thing.\n\n(c) Without being industrious, no one can prosper in life.\n\nOr, Being lazy/idle, none can prosper in life.\n\n(d) Those who are idle, always lag behind.\n\n(e) We must work hard to earn money.\n\n(f) We will work hard and thus we can improve our lot.\n\n(g) A hard-working person can see the light of prosperity.\n\n(h) Women should not work less than men.\n\n(i) It should be remembered by us that industry is the key to success.\n\nOr, That industry is the key to success should be remembered by us.\n\n(j) What a miserable life an idle man leads!",
        "explanation": "(a) Who does not want to succeed in life? — This is an interrogative sentence because it asks a question beginning with the question word \"Who\", so it is not assertive.\n\n(b) It is not an easy thing. — This is negative: the word \"not\" negates the statement, so it is not an affirmative sentence.\n\n(c) Being industrious, everyone can prosper in life. — This is affirmative because the main clause (\"everyone can prosper\") affirms a positive possibility; the opening participle phrase does not make it negative.\n\n(d) The idle always lag behind. — This is a simple declarative sentence with one subject and one predicate, so it is simple rather than complex.\n\n(e) We must work hard so that we can earn money. — This is complex because it has a main clause (\"We must work hard\") plus a subordinate purpose clause (\"so that we can earn money\").\n\n(f) By working hard, we can improve our lot. — This is a simple sentence: one main clause with an introductory participial phrase, not a compound (which would have two independent clauses).\n\n(g) The light of prosperity can be seen by a hard working person. — This is passive voice because the subject (\"the light of prosperity\") receives the action and the agent appears in a \"by\" phrase; the active form would be \"A hard-working person can see the light of prosperity.\"\n\n(h) Women should work as much as men. — This is comparative (equality) because \"as much as\" compares the amount of work between women and men.\n\n(i) We should remember that industry is the key to success. — This is active voice: the subject \"we\" performs the action \"should remember\"; it is not passive.\n\n(j) An idle man leads a very miserable life. — This is a declarative/affirmative (assertive) sentence stating a fact; it is not exclamatory, which would express strong emotion or use an exclamation.",

        "explanation": "The correction is right because each spoken line is written as direct speech in quotation marks, begins with a capital letter, and ends with punctuation that matches the tone (an exclamation for anger, a period for a statement). When a speech tag follows in the same sentence, put a comma inside the closing quote before the tag (for example, \"Please let me go,\" the mouse cried), but if the speech ends with an exclamation or question mark the strong punctuation stays inside the quotes and the tag is lowercased (for example, \"How dare you wake me up!\" the lion roared). These punctuation rules make it clear who is speaking and preserve the intended emotion.",

        "explanation": "(a) We should read books so that we may acquire knowledge.  \nThis is a complex sentence because it has a main clause (\"We should read books\") and a subordinate purpose clause (\"so that we may acquire knowledge\").\n\n(b) We are introduced to the realm of knowledge by books.  \nPassive voice is formed with a form of \"be\" + past participle; the original object (\"us\"/\"we\") becomes the subject and \"books\" becomes the agent introduced by \"by.\"\n\n(c) Do the books of great writers contain noble thoughts and great ideas?  \nTo make it interrogative, place the auxiliary \"do\" before the subject (\"the books\") and keep the main verb in base form.\n\n(d) By reading good books, we can enrich our mind, and we can broaden our knowledge.  \nThis is a compound sentence because it joins two independent clauses (\"we can enrich our mind\" and \"we can broaden our knowledge\") with the coordinating conjunction \"and.\"\n\n(e) What a very good habit reading books is!  \nAn exclamatory sentence uses \"What...\" (or \"How...\") to show strong feeling and inverts the usual order for emphasis.\n\n(f) Most people like this habit.  \nTo make it affirmative, express the idea positively: \"rarely disliked\" becomes \"liked by most people\" (here phrased as \"Most people like this habit\").\n\n(g) People should read more and more books.  \nActive voice makes the doer (\"People\") the subject who performs the action, instead of the passive \"books should be read.\"\n\n(h) Reading books is more interesting than anything else.  \nUse the comparative form \"more ... than\" to compare reading books with other things.\n\n(i) Reading good books opens up new worlds.  \nA simple sentence has a single independent clause; here \"Reading good books\" is the subject and \"opens up new worlds\" is the predicate.\n\n(f) A good book is the best of friends.  \nTo form the superlative, use \"best\" to show the highest degree, replacing the comparative idea \"as great as.\"",

        "explanation": "(a) Complex sentence: Once upon a time, two friends were passing by a forest when they heard a rustling sound.\nExplanation: This is complex because it has an independent clause (\"two friends were passing by a forest\") and a dependent time clause introduced by \"when\"; the dependent clause adds extra information and makes the sentence complex.\n\n(b) Interrogative: Were they talking about their love for each other?\nExplanation: Forming a question requires inversion of the auxiliary verb and the subject (\"Were\" + \"they\"), which turns the statement into an interrogative.\n\n(c) Simple sentence: Suddenly, they saw a bear approaching.\nExplanation: The simple sentence contains a single main clause with one verb phrase (\"saw a bear approaching\"); removing the relative clause makes it one independent clause.\n\n(d) Complex sentence: When the bear appeared, the first friend climbed up a tree.\nExplanation: This is complex because it joins a subordinate time clause (\"When the bear appeared\") to the main clause, so there is a dependent clause plus an independent clause.\n\n(e) Affirmative sentence: The latter failed to climb up the tree.\nExplanation: This affirmative form conveys the same idea without using \"not\" by using a positive verb (\"failed\") to express inability.\n\n(f) Passive voice: No way was found by him.\nExplanation: In passive voice the object (\"no way\") becomes the subject and the verb uses a form of \"to be\" + past participle (\"was found\"), with the agent optionally added (\"by him\").\n\n(g) Simple sentence: He lay on the ground, feigning death.\nExplanation: Using the participle phrase \"feigning death\" attaches information to the main clause without adding another clause, so the sentence remains one simple clause.\n\n(h) Passive voice: His ears, nose, and face were smelled by the bear.\nExplanation: The object(s) (\"his ears, nose, and face\") become the subject of the passive clause, followed by \"were\" + past participle (\"smelled\"), and the agent is introduced with \"by the bear.\"\n\n(i) Complex sentence: Because he lay motionless, people thought that he was dead.\nExplanation: This is complex because it contains a subordinate reason clause (\"Because he lay motionless\") plus the main clause; the subordinate clause explains why the main clause happened.\n\n(j) Complex sentence: After the bear went away, he escaped.\nExplanation: The time clause \"After the bear went away\" is a dependent clause joined to the main clause \"he escaped,\" making the sentence complex.",

        "solution": "(a) Very few well-known poets in English literature are as/so good as William Wordsworth.\n\n(b) Wasn't he the second of his father's five sons?\n\nOr. He was none but the second of his father's five sons.\n\n(c) Cumberland was the place where he was born on April 4, 1770.\n\nOr, He was born in Cumberland when it was April 4, 1770.\n\nOr, When it was April 4, 1770, he was born in Cumberland.\n\n(d) His mother died at his eight years old.\n\nOr. At his eight years old his mother died.\n\n(e) In the same year he was sent to the Grammar School of Hawkshead and he was educated there.\n\n(f) Wasn't he only 13 years old when his father died?\n\n(g) The teachers had given him fundamental education at the school.\n\n(h) The education learnt from this institution played better role in his life.\n\n(i) A new edition of his famous book, \"The Lyrical Ballads\" was called for by the readers in 1800.\n\n(j) What a name and fame this book brought in his life!",
        "explanation": "Explanation:\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ea\u003C/span\u003E Correctly called “Positive” because it is an affirmative (declarative) sentence stating a fact about Wordsworth without any negation or question.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eb\u003C/span\u003E This is not a negative sentence; it is an affirmative declarative stating a fact. A negative sentence would include words like “not” or other negators.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ec\u003C/span\u003E The sentence is not complex; it is a simple declarative with a time phrase [math]“on April 4, 1770”[/math] rather than a subordinate clause. A complex sentence needs a dependent clause with its own subject and verb.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ed\u003C/span\u003E This is actually complex, not simple, because it begins with the subordinate clause [math]“When he was eight years old”[/math] (it has its own subject and verb) followed by the main clause “his mother died.”\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ee\u003C/span\u003E This is not compound but a simple sentence: it contains a single independent clause describing an action in that year, with no second independent clause joined by a conjunction.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ef\u003C/span\u003E It is not interrogative; it is a declarative sentence. It is complex because the phrase [math]“when his father died”[/math] is a subordinate clause attached to the main clause.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eg\u003C/span\u003E This sentence is passive (the action is received: “had been given to him”); the active form would be “The school had given him fundamental education.” Therefore labeling it “Active” is incorrect.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eh\u003C/span\u003E This is complex, not simple, because it contains a relative (dependent) clause [math]“that he learnt from this institution”[/math] modifying “The education,” so there is more than one clause.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ei\u003C/span\u003E The sentence is active: “The readers” is the subject performing the action “called for.” The passive version would be “A new edition was called for by the readers,” so labeling it “Passive” is wrong.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ej\u003C/span\u003E This is a declarative sentence, not exclamatory; an exclamatory sentence would show strong emotion and typically use an exclamation form (e.g., “What a famous book this was!”).",

        "explanation": "(a) This is a simple sentence with an appositive phrase \"one of my cousins\" giving extra information about the subject; there is only one finite verb (\"is\"), so it's simple.\n\n(b) \"Older\" is the comparative degree of \"old\" used to compare two people, so the sentence shows a comparative degree.\n\n(c) This is a simple sentence: one main clause (\"He wants\") with an object phrase (\"his students to be good citizens\"); the infinitive phrase does not make a separate clause.\n\n(d) It is affirmative because it states a positive action (he tries very hard); there is no negation.\n\n(e) This is a complex sentence: it has a main clause (\"He becomes very happy\") and a subordinate adverbial clause introduced by \"when\" (\"when the students achieve good results\"), so there are two parts with different roles.\n\n(f) It is simple: one subject and one finite verb (\"is\"), with two linked adjectives joined by the correlative pair \"not only... but also,\" so still a single clause.\n\n(g) \"Best\" is the superlative degree of \"good/good,\" showing the highest degree among more than two, so the sentence expresses a superlative.\n\n(h) This is negative because it contains the negative auxiliary \"cannot,\" indicating inability or impossibility.\n\n(i) It is a complex sentence because the main action (\"He goes to class\") is followed by a subordinate time/condition phrase (\"after taking preparation\"), forming a main clause plus a subordinate element.\n\n(j) The sentence is active voice: the subject (\"All the students\") performs the action (\"respect him\"); the passive form would be \"He is respected by all the students.\"",

        "explanation": "(a) Assertive: \"Everyone wants to succeed in life.\"  \nReason: An interrogative asking if anybody does not want success is best turned into a universal affirmative by stating the general truth — \"everyone\" — as the assertive form.\n\n(b) Passive: \"Is it known to you?\"  \nReason: To make passive, the object \"it\" becomes the subject and the verb changes to passive form \"is known,\" with \"to you\" indicating the agent/recipient.\n\n(c) Complex: \"If a man is industrious, he will shine in life.\"  \nReason: A complex sentence has a main clause plus a subordinate clause; using an \"if\" conditional links cause (being industrious) to result (shining in life), forming a complex sentence.\n\n(d) Active: \"One must work hard to succeed.\"  \nReason: Change the impersonal passive \"is needed\" into an active verb with an explicit subject (\"one\") so the doer performs the action in the active voice.\n\n(e) Negative: \"A life without an assignment is not an actual life.\"  \nReason: Negation is formed by replacing \"with\" by \"without\" and adding \"not\" to deny the original affirmative statement.\n\n(f) Simple: \"Hard work is necessary for any reward.\"  \nReason: A simple sentence states the idea directly without subordinate clauses; replacing \"No one can receive… unless…\" by a single-clause statement expresses the same necessity simply.\n\n(g) Interrogative: \"Can one be successful without it?\"  \nReason: To form a question, invert the modal auxiliary \"can\" and the subject \"one\" so the sentence becomes interrogative.\n\n(h) Exclamatory: \"How happy a successful man is!\"  \nReason: Exclamatory sentences use \"how\" (or \"what\") plus an adjective/noun to express strong feeling, turning a plain statement into an exclamation.\n\n(i) Superlative: \"A successful man is the happiest of all.\"  \nReason: The superlative uses \"the\" + adjective + \"-est\" (or \"most\") to show the highest degree; \"of all\" emphasizes comparison with everyone else.\n\n(j) Positive: \"A hardworking man is healthy; an idle man is not.\"  \nReason: The positive degree states qualities without comparison by using the base adjective (\"healthy\") and, if contrast is needed, the opposite form for the other subject.",

        "explanation": "\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ea\u003C/span\u003E This is a positive (affirmative) sentence because it states a fact/opinion directly without any negation or question; it affirms that corruption is among the worst evils.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eb\u003C/span\u003E It is called complex because the main idea (\"A corrupted man can do anything\") is expanded by an additional clause/phrase (\"against morality\") that describes manner and tightens the meaning; a complex sentence mixes a main clause with subordinate information to give fuller detail.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ec\u003C/span\u003E The label “passive” applies when the object becomes the subject, e.g. the passive form is \"A corrupted man is hated by people\"; passive voice is formed with an appropriate form of \"be\" + past participle to show the action is received.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ed\u003C/span\u003E An interrogative asks a question; to make this sentence interrogative we invert the auxiliary: \"Does nobody respect him?\" or more naturally \"Does anyone respect him?\"; the sentence form changes to request information rather than state a fact.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ee\u003C/span\u003E It’s treated as simple here because it expresses one main idea with a single finite verb (\"is\"); though it contains a relative phrase (\"who takes bribe\") that describes the subject, the sentence conveys one complete thought centered on \"is next to devil.\"\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ef\u003C/span\u003E It’s labeled compound because it shows two contrasted clauses joined by a conjunction and expressing related ideas: one clause states a condition (\"Though we have strict law\") and the other states the result/contrast (\"we are still affected by this evil\"); such coordination or linking of clauses yields a compound/complex sense that contrasts two equal points.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eg\u003C/span\u003E This is marked superlative because it expresses the highest degree of hatred by comparing everyone else to the corrupted man (\"No other person is as hated as a corrupted man\"), effectively singling him out as most hated.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Eh\u003C/span\u003E It’s classed simple because it conveys a single straightforward thought (\"We hope\") with a clear object clause; the sentence is a single declarative statement expressing a hope about Bangladesh’s future.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ei\u003C/span\u003E It’s considered negative in sense because it indicates refusal of association—people do not associate with him (\"everybody avoids him\"), so the sentence expresses a negative social response even though grammatically it uses an affirmative verb.\n\n\u003Cspan class=\"cq-explanation-label\"\u003Ej\u003C/span\u003E The exclamatory label applies when the idea is expressed with strong feeling, e.g. as an exclamation: \"What an unhappy life a corrupted man leads!\"—such a form uses exclamatory structure or punctuation to show strong emotion.",

(Active)\n\n(i) Every year a lot of people come to visit it. (Compound)\n\n(j) If I could visit the sea-beach! (active)",
        "solution": "(a) My friend invited me that/ in order that/ so that I could/might pay a visit to Cox's Bazar.\n\nOr, It is my friend who invited me to pay a visit to Cox's Bazar.\n\nOr, Cox's Bazar is the place where my friend invited me to visit.\n\n(b) I was not (very) displeased/unhappy/sad at all.\n\nOr, I could not but become glad.\n\n(c) The invitation was accepted by me.\n\n(d) My friend received me cordially at the time of my reaching there.\n\nOr, After/On reaching/Reaching there, my friend received me cordially.\n\n(e) How excited I was to see the seabeach!\n\n(f) It is larger than any other sea-beach (all other sea-beaches) in the world.\n\n(g) Very few seabeaches in the world are so/as beautiful as it.\n\n(h) We/People call it the pleasure seekers paradise.\n\n(i) Every year a lot of people come here and (they) visit it.\n\n(j) I wish I could visit the seabeach.\n\nOr, Would that I could visit the seabeach.",
        "explanation": "(a) To make it a complex sentence you need a main clause plus a subordinate clause; for example, add a reason or time: \"My friend invited me to pay a visit to Cox’s Bazar because he wanted to show me around.\" A complex sentence has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.\n\n(b) Make it negative by placing \"not\" after the auxiliary verb: \"I was not very glad.\" Negation is formed by adding \"not\" (or a contraction) to the verb phrase.\n\n(c) Passive: turn the object into the subject and use the appropriate form of \"be\" + past participle: \"The invitation was accepted by me.\" In passive voice the original object becomes the subject and the doer is optional after \"by.\"\n\n(d) To make it a simple sentence remove the subordinate clause and keep a single independent clause: \"My friend received me cordially.\" A simple sentence has one independent clause only.\n\n(e) Exclamatory: express strong feeling with \"How\" or an exclamation mark: \"How excited I was to see the sea-beach!\" Exclamatory sentences show strong emotion and often begin with \"What/How\" or end with an exclamation mark.\n\n(f) Comparative: compare two things using \"more/er ... than\": e.g., \"It is larger than any other sea-beach nearby.\" Comparative degree uses \"more\" or \"-er\" plus \"than\" to show comparison between two items.\n\n(g) Positive: use the base adjective without comparison or superlative: \"It is beautiful.\" The positive degree simply states the quality without comparing it to others.\n\n(h) Active: make the agent the subject and use an active verb: \"People call it the pleasure seekers’ paradise.\" In active voice the subject performs the action directly.\n\n(i) Compound: join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction: \"Every year a lot of people come to visit it, and they enjoy the beach.\" A compound sentence has two (or more) independent clauses joined by and, but, or, etc.\n\n(j) Active: the sentence is already active because the subject \"I\" is the doer of \"visit\" (expressing a wish): \"If I could visit the sea-beach!\" Active voice has the subject performing the action.",

        "explanation": "(a) To make it interrogative you invert the auxiliary and subject; since the verb is [math]is[/math], ask: \"Is a flower a glowing gift of nature?\" This makes it a question.\n\n(b) Change the negative question to a positive statement by removing the negative contraction and the question mark: \"It is the symbol of love and beauty.\" This makes it affirmative.\n\n(c) The sentence is passive (\"are used\"); to make it active, put the doer as the subject and change the verb: \"People use flowers on different occasions.\" Passive agent becomes the subject in active voice.\n\n(d) To form the passive from the active, make the object the subject and use the appropriate form of \"to be\" + past participle: \"Flowers are presented to our nearest and dearest person (by us).\" This shows passive construction.\n\n(e) To make it complex, add a subordinate clause (reason/purpose) with a subordinating conjunction: \"Because we want to decorate a place, we need flowers.\" A complex sentence has an independent clause plus a dependent clause.\n\n(f) \"The rose is the best of all flowers\" is superlative; the positive degree removes comparison: \"The rose is good\" or \"The rose is a beautiful flower.\" Positive degree uses the base adjective without comparative/superlative markers.\n\n(g) Turn the participial phrase into a separate independent clause and join with a coordinating conjunction to make a compound sentence: \"The flower has a sweet scent and beauty, and we love it very much.\" A compound sentence connects two independent clauses.\n\n(h) Change the comparative phrase into the superlative by using \"the\" + superlative form: \"It is the loveliest of all flowers.\" Superlative shows the highest degree among all.\n\n(i) Use an exclamatory structure with \"What\" or \"How\": \"What a very nice flower the rose is!\" This expresses strong feeling, so it becomes exclamatory.\n\n(j) To make it simple, keep a single independent clause and remove the subordinating element: \"We should cultivate flowers on a commercial basis.\" A simple sentence has only one independent clause.",

(Passive)\n\n(j) Muhsin was one of the best philanthropists in the world. (Positive)",
        "solution": "(a) Haji Mohammad Muhsin was a very kind man.\n\n(b) Didn't he inherit vast property from his father and sister?\n\n(c) He was not married/He did not marry.\n\n(d) When he was alive, he spent money lavishly to help the poor.\n\nOr. It was his lifetime when he spent money lavishly to help the poor room.\n\n(e) One night at the time of saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room.\n\nOr. One night while praying a thief broke into his room.\n\nOr. One night during the time of saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room.\n\n(f) The thief saw Muhsin and cried.\n\n(g) Muhsin/He caught the thief.\n\n(h) The thief was very needy.\n\n(i) Some food and money were given to the thief by him.\n\nOr, The thief was given some food and money by him.\n\n(j) Very few philanthropists in the world were so/as good as Muhsin.",
        "explanation": "(a) The sentence uses litotes (“not unkind”) but conveys a positive meaning; the clear affirmative form is “Haji Mohammad Muhsin was a kind man.” Affirmative sentences state something positively rather than denying it.\n\n(b) To make it interrogative use the auxiliary + subject + base verb pattern: “Did he inherit vast property from his father and sister?” Interrogative sentences are formed by inversion and end with a question mark.\n\n(c) “He was unmarried” is negative because the prefix “un-” shows negation (not married); you can also write it as “He was not married.” Negative sentences express non-existence or denial.\n\n(d) It’s complex because it has a main clause “he spent money lavishly” plus a subordinate purpose clause “to help the poor” (and a temporal phrase “During his lifetime”). A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause or phrase.\n\n(e) A simple sentence has one independent clause expressing a single idea; the simple version is “One night a thief broke into his room.” It contains one main verb and one complete thought.\n\n(f) A compound sentence joins two independent clauses of equal weight; e.g. “Muhsin saw the thief, and the thief cried.” Use a coordinating conjunction or semicolon to link the clauses.\n\n(g) Active voice places the doer before the verb; the active form is “Someone caught the thief.” Convert passive to active by making the agent the subject and using the main verb in the appropriate tense.\n\n(h) An assertive (declarative) sentence states a fact; the assertive form is “The thief was very needy.” It simply declares the thief’s condition without exclamation.\n\n(i) Passive voice makes the object the subject: “Some food and money were given to the thief by him.” Form the passive with the correct form of “be” + past participle, and optionally include the agent with “by.”\n\n(j) The sentence praises Muhsin, so it is positive in tone: it affirms a good quality (“one of the best philanthropists in the world”). Positive sentences state affirming information rather than negation.",

        "solution": "(a) The students who study regularly can expect a good result.\n\n(b) But most of our students are not attentive to their studies.\n\n(c) Their valuable time is wasted idly by them.\n\n(d) Isn't wasting time harmful to them?\n\n(e) When as they repeat this activity, they make a poor result.\n\nOr.

        "explanation": "(a) \"If students study regularly, they can expect a good result.\"  \nExplanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a subordinate clause (\"If students study regularly\") that conditionally supports the main clause (\"they can expect a good result\"), showing cause and result.\n\n(b) \"Most of our students are not attentive to their studies.\"  \nExplanation: Changing \"inattentive\" to \"not attentive\" keeps the original negative meaning while using an explicit negative form.\n\n(c) \"Their valuable time is wasted idly by them.\"  \nExplanation: The verb phrase is made passive (\"is wasted\"), moving the focus from the doer to the object (\"their valuable time\"); the agent \"by them\" shows who causes it.\n\n(d) \"Is wasting time harmful for them?\"  \nExplanation: To form the question, the auxiliary \"is\" is placed before the subject phrase \"wasting time,\" turning the statement into an interrogative.\n\n(e) \"If they repeat this activity, they will make poor results.\"  \nExplanation: This is a complex sentence: the conditional subordinate clause (\"If they repeat this activity\") leads to the main clause expressing the consequence (\"they will make poor results\"), showing cause and effect. (You can also say \"they will get poor results\" for more natural wording.)\n\n(f) \"No one loves them then.\"  \nExplanation: The interrogative \"Who loves them then?\" implies a negative answer; converting it to an assertive sentence uses \"No one\" to state that directly while preserving meaning.\n\n(g) \"Even their family members treat them badly.\"  \nExplanation: Active voice makes the agent (\"their family members\") the subject performing the action (\"treat them badly\"), which reverses the original passive structure.\n\n(h) \"A failed student suffers from an inferiority complex.\"  \nExplanation: This simple sentence condenses the conditional idea into a single statement by using \"failed\" as an adjective describing the student.\n\n(i) \"A failed student is the worst in the class.\"  \nExplanation: The comparative idea (\"No other student ... is as bad\") is changed to a superlative form (\"the worst\") to show that the failed student ranks lowest among all students.\n\n(j) \"A student should study regularly and attentively to do well in the examination.\"  \nExplanation: The complex original is simplified by combining purpose into an infinitive phrase (\"to do well\"), making one clear simple sentence that states duty and result.",

        "explanation": "(a) What a popular poet Madhusudan Dutt was!  \nThis is exclamatory: \"What\" + noun phrase + subject + verb expresses strong feeling.\n\n(b) He was a great dramatist in Bangla literature.  \nPositive degree uses the base adjective \"great\" instead of the superlative/comparative phrase \"one of the greatest.\"\n\n(c) He was born at Sagordari, which lies on the bank of the Kapotaksho.  \nThis is a complex sentence because it has an independent clause (\"He was born at Sagordari\") plus a dependent relative clause (\"which lies on the bank of the Kapotaksho\") that adds extra information.\n\n(d) As a boy he desired to be an Englishman.  \nA simple sentence with one independent clause stating the subject, time phrase, and action.\n\n(e) His teachers recognised him as a precious child.  \nActive voice: the doer (\"his teachers\") is the subject and performs the verb \"recognised\" on the object \"him.\"\n\n(f) Did he think that he was born on the wrong side of the planet?  \nFormed as an interrogative by using the auxiliary \"did\" for past tense and placing it before the subject.\n\n(g) He also thought that his society did not appreciate his intellect.  \nNegative sentence: \"did not\" negates the verb \"appreciate,\" conveying the same idea as \"was unable to appreciate.\"\n\n(h) Again he believed that only the West would be more receptive to his creative genius.  \nAffirmative form replaces the negative phrase \"none but\" with the positive word \"only.\"\n\n(i) Was he an ardent follower of Lord Byron?  \nInterrogative formed by inverting the auxiliary \"was\" and the subject \"he.\"\n\n(j) He went to Europe and began composing poems.  \nA simple sentence with one subject doing two actions (compound predicate) within a single independent clause.",

One night while saying his prayer, a thief broke into his room.\n\n(j) Though/Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him.",
        "explanation": "(a) Answer: Haji Muhammad Muhsin was generous.\nExplanation: \"More generous\" is comparative; the positive degree uses the base adjective \"generous\" without comparison.\n\n(b) Answer: He was born in Hoogly, where he spent his early years.\nExplanation: This is complex because it has one main clause (\"He was born in Hoogly\") and one dependent relative clause (\"where he spent his early years\") that cannot stand alone.\n\n(c) Answer: Did he inherit a vast property from his father and sister?\nExplanation: Past simple questions are formed by adding the auxiliary \"did\" and using the base form of the verb (\"inherit\"), with subject–auxiliary inversion.\n\n(d) Answer: This wealth was not misused by him.\nExplanation: Passive voice makes the object (\"this wealth\") the subject and uses a form of \"be\" + past participle (\"was ... misused\"); the agent can be added with \"by ...\".\n\n(e) Answer: People call him the friend of humanity.\nExplanation: Active voice names the doer (\"People\") as the subject and the person acted on (\"him\") as the object, using a simple present active verb (\"call\").\n\n(f) Answer: He remained a bachelor.\nExplanation: This is an affirmative statement of the same fact; it reports his marital status without using negation.\n\n(g) Answer: While he was alive, he spent money lavishly to help the poor.\nExplanation: This is a complex sentence because it begins with a subordinate adverbial clause (\"While he was alive\") followed by the main clause describing his spending.\n\n(h) Answer: He was kind, and he could not refuse anyone's request.\nExplanation: This is a compound sentence: two independent clauses (\"He was kind\" and \"he could not refuse anyone's request\") joined by the coordinating conjunction \"and.\"\n\n(i) Answer: One night a thief broke into his room during his prayer.\nExplanation: This is a simple sentence with a single independent clause; \"during his prayer\" is a prepositional phrase, not a subordinate clause.\n\n(j) Answer: Although he caught the thief, he did not punish him.\nExplanation: This is complex because it uses a subordinate concessive clause (\"Although he caught the thief\") plus a main clause (\"he did not punish him\"), showing contrast.",

        "explanation": "(a) Since health is wealth, one should take care of it.\nExplanation: This is a complex sentence because it has a main clause and a subordinate clause introduced by \"since,\" which shows reason.\n\n(b) A sick moneyed man is not as happy as a healthy poor man.\nExplanation: The comparative \"happier than\" is changed to the positive-degree form \"not as ... as,\" keeping the same meaning while using the base adjective \"happy.\"\n\n(c) A healthy man is an asset to his family, but an unhealthy man is a liability.\nExplanation: Two independent clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction \"but,\" making a compound sentence.\n\n(d) Can he succeed in life?\nExplanation: Forming an interrogative with a modal verb requires inverting the subject and the auxiliary: \"can\" + subject + main verb.\n\n(e) So, everybody must be conscious of his health.\nExplanation: \"Cannot but be\" means \"must be,\" so the affirmative form uses \"must\" + adjective to express the same idea.\n\n(f) Everybody must not neglect to take care of his health all the time.\nExplanation: This negative sentence uses \"must not neglect to...\" to express the required obligation in a negated form while preserving the original meaning.\n\n(g) Regular physical exercise and a balanced diet can improve health.\nExplanation: Convert the passive \"Health can be improved by...\" into active voice by making the agents the subject and the action active.\n\n(h) Poor people cannot afford a balanced diet.\nExplanation: The relative clause \"who are poor\" is reduced to the simple noun phrase \"poor people,\" forming a simple sentence with one subject and one predicate.\n\n(i) How concerned they are with the quantity of food!\nExplanation: An exclamatory sentence is formed with \"How\" plus adjective and subject to express strong feeling.\n\n(j) It should be known by everybody that weakness is caused by malnutrition.\nExplanation: \"Everybody should know\" is changed to passive \"It should be known by everybody,\" and \"malnutrition causes weakness\" is converted to the passive \"weakness is caused by malnutrition.\"",

(Simple) (d) Computers are nowadays being used in almost every sphere of life. (Active) (e) We cannot but depend on it. (Affirmative) (f) No one can deny its necessity. (Interrogative) (g) It is the most used device in our life. (Comparative) (h) It helps us a lot. (Passive) (i) Because of its usefulness, it has become very popular. (Compound) (j) Without computer, we cannot imagine our modern life. (Complex)",
        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "(a) Correct: Positive (affirmative declarative). This sentence praises the computer and states a fact without any negation, so it is positive and declarative.  \n\n(b) Correct classification is Positive, not Negative. The sentence expresses a favourable view (“a blessing”) and contains no negation, so it is positive.  \n\n(c) Correct: Complex. The subordinating conjunction \"Though\" introduces a subordinate clause, so the sentence has a dependent clause plus a main clause, making it complex.  \n\n(d) Correct: Passive. The verb phrase \"are being used\" is passive voice (the action is received by \"computers\"), not active.  \n\n(e) Correct as Affirmative in meaning. Although it contains \"cannot,\" the idiom \"cannot but depend\" means \"must depend\" (an affirmative meaning), so its force is affirmative.  \n\n(f) Correct classification is Negative (declarative), not Interrogative. \"No one\" negates the sentence, so it is a negative declarative statement.  \n\n(g) Correct: Superlative, not comparative. The word \"most\" shows the highest degree (superlative), whereas comparative would use \"more.\"  \n\n(h) Correct: Active. The subject \"It\" performs the action \"helps,\" so the sentence is in active voice, not passive.  \n\n(i) Correct: Simple (not compound). The sentence has a single independent clause with an adverbial phrase \"Because of its usefulness,\" so it is a simple sentence.  \n\n(j) Correct: Simple (not complex). \"Without computer\" is an introductory prepositional phrase and the rest is one independent clause, so the whole sentence is a simple declarative sentence.",

(Active) (f) Who is not now in the threat of violence? (Assertive) (g) Though there are laws to punish the terrorists, they are not properly applied. (Compound) (h) By applying the laws properly, we can get rid of terrorism. (Complex) (i) What a miserable life a terrorist leads! (Assertive) (j) They should be brought to book. (Active)",
        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "(a) Correct: Exclamatory. Reason: The sentence expresses strong feeling and would normally end with an exclamation mark, which makes it exclamatory.\n\n(b) Correct label: Declarative (Assertive), not Interrogative. Reason: It states a fact and ends with a full stop, so it is a statement, not a question.\n\n(c) Correct: Comparative. Reason: The structure \"as … as\" compares two things, showing degree of comparison.\n\n(d) Correct label: Superlative, not Positive. Reason: \"one of the most corrosive\" uses \"most,\" indicating the highest degree among a group.\n\n(e) Correct label: Passive, not Active. Reason: The subject (\"A terrorist\") receives the action (\"is hated\"); the active form would be \"People hate a terrorist.\"\n\n(f) Correct: Interrogative, not Assertive. Reason: It asks a question beginning with \"Who,\" so it is an interrogative sentence.\n\n(g) Correct: Complex, not Compound. Reason: It has a subordinate clause introduced by \"Though\" plus a main clause, so one dependent and one independent clause (complex).\n\n(h) Correct label: Simple (Declarative), not Complex. Reason: There is a single main clause with a participial phrase (\"By applying…\")—so it is a simple declarative sentence.\n\n(i) Correct: Exclamatory, not Assertive. Reason: \"What a miserable life…!\" expresses strong feeling and is an exclamation.\n\n(j) Correct label: Passive, not Active. Reason: The verb phrase \"should be brought\" is passive (the subject receives the action).",

(পরিণামে অলসরা কতই না চরম কষ্ট ভোগ করে!) (e) To commit suicide is not more harmful than to kill time.

        "explanation": "(a) I am not sure that man is the maker of his own fortune.\nExplanation: Negation is formed by inserting \"not\" after the auxiliary \"am,\" which turns the affirmative certainty into its negative form.\n\n(b) Use your time properly to shine in life.\nExplanation: An imperative gives a direct command; here the verb \"use\" is in the base form addressing the reader to make the sentence imperative.\n\n(c) By whom is it not known?\nExplanation: To make the question passive, the object (\"it\") becomes the subject and the agent is expressed with \"by,\" changing the structure while keeping the meaning.\n\n(d) How miserably the lazy suffer in the long run!\nExplanation: Exclamatory sentences often begin with \"How\" or \"What\" to emphasize feeling; here \"How miserably...\" expresses strong emotion about their suffering.\n\n(e) Killing time is as harmful as committing suicide.\nExplanation: Use of gerunds (\"killing,\" \"committing\") and the structure \"as ... as\" makes a comparative of equality, showing two actions are equally harmful.\n\n(f) Our life is not only a sum total of hours, days and years.\nExplanation: Changing \"only\" to \"not only\" makes the sentence negative while implying there is more to life than just its measurable parts.\n\n(g) Youth is a valuable season of life.\nExplanation: Converting the superlative \"most valuable\" to the positive degree uses the base adjective \"valuable,\" stating the quality without comparison.\n\n(h) We can easily shape our minds in youth.\nExplanation: Active voice makes the doer (\"we\") the subject and uses the verb \"shape\" directly; adverb placement \"easily\" modifies the verb.\n\n(i) Utilize your time properly in youth.\nExplanation: The imperative form uses the base verb \"utilize\" (or \"use\") to give a direct instruction to the reader.\n\n(j) People call it the seedtime of life.\nExplanation: To change from passive (\"it is called\") to active, introduce a subject (\"People\") who perform the action and use the verb \"call.\"",

        "explanation": "(a) \"We are not ungrateful to the freedom fighters.\"  \nExplanation: Negation is formed by adding \"not\" or using the negative adjective \"ungrateful\"; here \"are not ungrateful\" expresses the negative of \"are grateful.\"\n\n(b) \"Their contribution is the greatest.\"  \nExplanation: Superlative degree uses \"the\" + adjective + \"-est\" (or \"most\"); \"greatest\" shows their contribution is highest among all.\n\n(c) \"Never disrespect or forget our martyrs.\"  \nExplanation: Imperative sentences give commands and drop the subject \"you\"; the verbs start in base form (\"disrespect\", \"forget\") and \"never\" makes it a negative command.\n\n(d) \"They have built the national memorial to pay tribute to their memories.\"  \nExplanation: To change passive to active, introduce the agent (\"they\") and use an active verb form (\"have built\") instead of \"has been built.\"\n\n(e) \"A freedom fighter is greater than any other son of the soil.\"  \nExplanation: Comparative degree compares two or more items using \"greater than\"; it replaces the superlative \"greatest\" with a comparative structure.\n\n(f) \"Our independence was won because of their sacrifice.\"  \nExplanation: Passive form emphasizes the object (\"our independence\") by making it the subject and using a past passive verb phrase (\"was won\") while the agent may be omitted.\n\n(g) \"How bravely they fought to snatch the red sun of independence!\"  \nExplanation: Exclamatory sentences use \"How\" (with adverb) or \"What\" (with noun) + subject + verb to express strong feeling.\n\n(h) \"Their courage was powerful.\"  \nExplanation: To put the sentence in the positive degree, remove the comparative \"more ... than\" and use the base adjective \"powerful.\"\n\n(i) \"We will never forget their contribution.\"  \nExplanation: Change passive (\"will never be forgotten\") to active by adding an agent (\"we\") and using an active verb (\"will never forget\").\n\n(j) \"Some steps have been taken by the government to improve their condition.\"  \nExplanation: Passive is formed by making the object (\"some steps\") the subject and using the appropriate form of \"be\" + past participle (\"have been taken\"), with the agent added after \"by.\"",

        "explanation": "Solution:\n(a) Honesty cannot open a door of peace before a person.\nExplanation: Changing the modal verb \"can\" to its negative form \"cannot\" makes the whole sentence negative while keeping the original meaning.\n\n(b) The invitation was accepted by him.\nExplanation: In passive voice the object \"the invitation\" becomes the subject, the verb uses auxiliary \"was\" + past participle \"accepted\", and the agent is expressed with \"by him.\"\n\n(c) Reading books is the noblest of all habits.\nExplanation: Replace the comparative phrase \"nobler than any other\" with the superlative form \"the noblest\" and add \"of all\" to show it is highest in rank.\n\n(d) What a very essential virtue it is to love one's country!\nExplanation: Use the exclamatory \"What...\" construction plus \"it is to...\" to turn the statement into an exclamation expressing strong feeling.\n\n(e) We do not measure our lives by months or years.\nExplanation: This keeps the active voice with \"we\" as the subject and corrects to the natural plural \"lives,\" expressing the same negative idea actively.\n\n(f) Industry is more important for success than anything else.\nExplanation: Change the superlative \"the most important\" into a comparative \"more important ... than ...\" and add a comparison phrase to complete it.\n\n(g) She was very attentive to her studies.\nExplanation: Convert the exclamatory \"How attentive she was!\" into a straightforward declarative sentence to make it assertive.\n\n(h) Terrorism is a very corrosive problem of the modern world.\nExplanation: Remove the superlative phrase \"one of the most\" and use the positive adjective \"very corrosive\" to express the idea in the positive degree.\n\n(i) Let us do good deeds as our responsibility.\nExplanation: Use the imperative-suggestive form \"Let us\" plus the base verb to turn the sentence into a command/suggestion.\n\n(j) Not everybody is fond of glittering things.\nExplanation: Placing \"Not\" before \"everybody\" makes the sentence negative without completely reversing the intended scope (unlike \"Nobody,\" which is stronger).",

        "explanation": "(a) Copying in the exams is one of the greatest social crimes. (Positive Degree)\n\n✅ Transformed: Very few social crimes are as great as copying in the exams.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: “One of the + superlative” → “Very few + plural noun + are as + positive degree + as...”\n\nএখানে \"one of the greatest\" একটি superlative expression, যেটি positive রূপে রূপান্তর করতে হয় “Very few...” দিয়ে শুরু করে।\n\n(b) It is a very serious crime. (Exclamatory)\n\n✅ Transformed: How serious a crime it is!\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: “It is a very + adjective + noun.” → “How + adjective + a + noun + it is!”\n\nএখানে “very serious crime” কে Exclamatory করার জন্য “How” দিয়ে শুরু করে অভিপ্রায় প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।\n\n(c) A student copying in the exam only deceives himself. (Negative)\n\n✅ Transformed: A student copying in the exam does not deceive anyone but himself.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: Affirmative → Negative by using “does not... but” structure\n\n“Only deceives himself” অর্থ বোঝাতে “does not deceive anyone but himself” ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।\n\n(d) Copying in the exam cannot bring any benefit. (Passive)\n\n✅ Transformed: No benefit can be brought by copying in the exam.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: Passive Voice: object + auxiliary + be + past participle + by + agent\n\nএখানে “bring” ক্রিয়াটিকে passive করতে “can be brought” করা হয়েছে এবং agent “copying in the exam” যোগ হয়েছে।\n\n(e) What a shameful practice it is! (Assertive)\n\n✅ Transformed: It is a very shameful practice.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: Exclamatory → Assertive: “What a/an + adjective + noun it is!” → “It is a very + adjective + noun.”\n\n“What a shameful practice it is!” একটি বিস্ময়বোধক বাক্য, যা assertive এ রূপান্তর করতে \"very shameful practice\" ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।\n\n(f) By resisting this malady, we can strengthen our education. (Passive)\n\n✅ Transformed: Our education can be strengthened by resisting this malady.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: Passive: object + can be + past participle + by + agent\n\n\"Strengthen\" verb-কে passive করতে “can be strengthened” রূপ নেওয়া হয়েছে।\n\n(g) We all should come forward to stop it and save our students. (Imperative)\n\n✅ Transformed: Let us all come forward to stop it and save our students.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: Suggestive imperative → “Let us...”\n\nযেহেতু এখানে একটি সমষ্টিগত আহ্বান বা উৎসাহ জ্ঞাপন করা হয়েছে, তাই “Let us...” দিয়ে imperative রূপ করা হয়েছে।\n\n(h) Our examination system should be moderated. (Active)\n\n✅ Transformed: Someone should moderate our examination system.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: Passive → Active: subject + modal + base verb + object\n\n“Should be moderated” এর Active রূপ হয় “should moderate” এবং ‘Someone’ একটি অব্যক্ত কর্তা (agent) হিসেবে যুক্ত হয়েছে।\n\n(i) Nothing is as hateful as copying in the exam. (Comparative)\n\n✅ Transformed: Copying in the exam is more hateful than anything else.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: Positive → Comparative: “Nothing is as + adjective + as...” → “Subject is more + adjective + than anything else.”\n\n“Nothing is as hateful as...” মানে হলো সবকিছুর চেয়ে এটি বেশি ঘৃণ্য — তাই comparative রূপে প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।\n\n(j) The government is sincere in removing this crime. (Negative)\n\n✅ Transformed: The government is not insincere in removing this crime.\n\n📝 Explanation:\n\nRule: Affirmative → Negative: “is sincere” → “is not insincere”\n\nDouble negative না করে অর্থ অক্ষুন্ন রেখে নেতিবাচক রূপে প্রকাশ করা হয়েছে।",

        "explanation": "Solution:\n\n(a) Jackfruit is a large fruit of Bangladesh.\nExplanation: The original superlative phrase \"one of the largest\" is changed to the positive degree by using the adjective \"large\" without comparison.\n\n(b) What a very juicy fruit it is!\nExplanation: An exclamatory sentence expresses strong feeling; here we use \"What a...\" structure and an exclamation to show emphasis.\n\n(c) It is considered very sweet.\nExplanation: \"Taste\" as a linking verb does not take a natural passive, so we use \"is considered\" to form a passive that preserves the original meaning.\n\n(d) It does not contain high calories.\nExplanation: To make the sentence negative in the simple present, add the auxiliary \"does not\" before the base verb.\n\n(e) Does everyone know it as our national fruit?\nExplanation: Forming a yes/no question in present simple requires the auxiliary \"does\" and inversion of subject and verb.\n\n(f) In summer, this fruit is not very available.\nExplanation: Make the sentence negative by inserting \"not\" after the auxiliary verb \"is.\"\n\n(g) People mainly find it in the month of Jaishtha.\nExplanation: Change the passive \"is found\" into an active form by introducing a doer (\"people\") and using the active verb \"find.\"\n\n(h) It is less costly than the mango.\nExplanation: \"Not as...as\" is changed to a comparative form \"less...than\" to compare the two items directly.\n\n(i) Eat the fruit to ensure nutrition.\nExplanation: An imperative sentence gives a command or advice; remove the subject and use the base verb \"eat.\"\n\n(j) Jackfruits look very beautiful in the trees.\nExplanation: Convert the exclamatory sentence into a plain assertive (declarative) sentence by stating the observation without exclamation.",

        "explanation": "Being \"conscious\" takes the preposition \"of\" and harm affects someone \"on\" them, so (a) = \"of the\" and (b) = \"on\". \"Both\" is followed by the article when referring to specific kinds, and we need \"the\" for the child's possession, so (c) = \"the\" and (d) = \"the\"; \"lead to\" is the correct verb-preposition collocation, so (e) = \"to\", and a specific punished child takes \"the\" at (f) = \"the\". For a general statement use \"a\" at (g) = \"a\"; someone feels \"hostile to\" others so (h) = \"to\"; finally, negative traits are described as \"rude and bad behaviour\" and behavior develops \"in\" a person, so (i) = \"and bad\" and (j) = \"in\".",
