        "solution": "(a) It is said that youth is the best part of our life .\n\n(b) In youth the mind is so soft that we can shape it according to our wish .\n\n(c) If we lose the morning hours of life, we can't reach the goal of life .\n\n(d) We will reap good harvest if we sow the good seeds with proper nursing .\n\n(e) On the other hand, if we remain lazy, we must suffer in the long run .",
        "explanation": "(a) The correct completion is a proverb about early rising and disciplined habits: it says that regular, orderly routines (like rising early) promote health, efficiency and success. This is right because habits formed by discipline produce better physical and mental results over time.\n\n(b) The right idea is that a young mind is pliable and easily shaped by teaching and example. That’s why education and good influence in youth have a lasting effect on character and behaviour.\n\n(c) The sentence means that once the early, most productive years are wasted they cannot be recovered. It’s correct because time is irreversible, so losing youthful opportunities reduces future potential.\n\n(d) This completes the cause–effect idea: if we sow good work or habits, we will reap a good harvest (good results). It’s true because effort and wise choices tend to produce corresponding positive outcomes.\n\n(e) The contrast shows that laziness brings failure or loss of opportunities. This is right because inactivity and neglect prevent progress, so one cannot expect good results without effort.",

        "solution": "(a) This is Bangladesh which is our motherland .\n\n(b) The people of Bangladesh are friendly though they are not rich .\n\n(c) When anyone falls in danger, others come forward to help him/her .\n\n(d) We love and help one another as if we were brothers .\n\n(e) We work seriously in order that Bangladesh can prosper day by day .",
        "explanation": "Explanation:\n(a) The blank needs a relative clause of place introduced by \"where\" (e.g. \"This is Bangladesh where I was born\") because \"Bangladesh\" is a place.  \n(b) \"Though\" shows contrast, so it should be followed by a contrasting fact or clause (e.g. \"though many are poor\" or \"though not wealthy\").  \n(c) This is a general truth, so use the simple present with the plural subject \"others\" (e.g. \"others help him/her\").  \n(d) \"As if\" makes a comparison and for an unreal or emphatic comparison we use the subjunctive/past form: \"as if we were brothers.\"  \n(e) \"In order that\" expresses purpose and is usually followed by \"may/might\" + verb (e.g. \"in order that Bangladesh may prosper\").",

        "explanation": "(a) if we read newspapers. Newspapers report important events at home and abroad, so reading them keeps us informed about current affairs.\n\n(b) lest they remain ignorant. \"Lest\" means to prevent something, so people read newspapers to avoid being uninformed about important news.\n\n(c) as they are too busy with studies or lack the habit. Many students prioritize academic work or have little time or interest, so they don’t read newspapers regularly.\n\n(d) by working in the newspaper industry (as journalists, printers, vendors, etc.). The newspaper business provides various jobs—reporting, editing, printing and selling—that people depend on for income.\n\n(e) when I read good news. Positive or favorable news gives pleasure and relief, so reading good news naturally makes one happy.",

        "explanation": "(a) No sooner had I reached home than it began to rain.\nExplanation: \"No sooner ... than\" shows that one event happened immediately after another and requires inversion (auxiliary before subject) in the first clause.\n\n(b) He was so lazy that he did not finish his work.\nExplanation: \"So ... that\" expresses a cause–result relationship: the adjective \"lazy\" is the cause and the clause after \"that\" gives the consequence.\n\n(c) It is health which makes life worth living.\nExplanation: This is a cleft/relative structure emphasizing \"health\"; \"which\" introduces the clause that describes the role or importance of health.\n\n(d) He succeeded though he had little experience.\nExplanation: \"Though\" introduces a concession meaning \"in spite of\"; it contrasts the unexpected success with the limiting condition.\n\n(e) As our elders love us, we should respect them.\nExplanation: \"As\" gives a reason (because), so the main clause expresses the appropriate response or consequence to that reason.",

        "explanation": "(a) \"I would help him if he told me.\" — This is a second conditional: the if-clause uses past simple \"told\" to show a hypothetical situation, so the main clause uses \"would\" + base verb (\"would help\").\n\n(b) \"The answer that he gave.\" — The relative clause uses past simple \"gave\" because it refers to a completed action in the past.\n\n(c) \"Finishing the work, he went home.\" — A participle clause (\"Finishing the work\") shows an action done just before the main action; the subject of the participle is the same as the subject of the main clause (\"he\").\n\n(d) \"I saw my mother crossing the road.\" — After perception verbs you can use \"object + -ing\" to show an ongoing action; you can also say \"I saw my mother cross the road\" (bare infinitive) to mean you witnessed the whole action.\n\n(e) \"To walk in the morning is healthy.\" — An infinitive phrase acts as the subject here, so it takes a singular verb (\"is\") and expresses a general truth or habit.",

        "solution": "",

(or \"lest we fall.\")  \nExplanation: \"Lest\" expresses prevention (\"in order that... not\") and is followed by a subjunctive form (often with \"should\") or the bare present to show the negative purpose.",

        "solution": "",
        "explanation": "(a) It matters little to me whether he comes or not.  \nExplanation: Here \"whether...or not\" introduces a noun clause that functions as the object of \"matters little,\" showing both alternatives are unimportant.\n\n(b) He pretended as if he were ill.  \nExplanation: \"As if\" shows a false appearance; the subjunctive \"were\" (or past form) is used because the situation is not real.\n\n(c) If I had the wings of a bird, I would fly.  \nExplanation: This is a hypothetical (second conditional): the past form \"had\" in the if-clause plus \"would\" in the main clause expresses an unreal present possibility.\n\n(d) Take your umbrella lest you get wet.  \nExplanation: \"Lest\" expresses negative purpose (\"so that... not\") and is followed by a verb (modern usage: \"lest you get wet\" or more formally \"lest you should get wet\").\n\n(e) Hardly had he started for school when it began to rain.  \nExplanation: Sentences with \"hardly\" use inversion (auxiliary before subject) and are usually followed by \"when/before\" to show that one event happened immediately after another.",
