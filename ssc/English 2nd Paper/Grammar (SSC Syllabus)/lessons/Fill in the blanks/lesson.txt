        "explanation": "The phrase \"Honesty is said to be the best policy\" uses the fixed passive \"said to be\" and the definite article \"the\"; \"strays from the path of morality\" uses the correct verb + preposition (\"stray from\") and the possessive \"of\"; \"admired by many but hated by some\" is a natural contrast, \"Some enemies...\" introduces that contrast again, \"honest and truthful\" are the correct adjectives, and \"throughout our life\" correctly expresses duration. These choices follow normal English collocations and grammar, so they clearly convey that honesty is recommended and should be maintained for life.",

        "question": "Punctuality is of (a)----- value to a student. An unpunctual (b)----- who is (c)------ in the class will miss a part of his/her lesson and (d)----- lag behind. But (e)------ his/her lesson in time and do (f)----- in the examination. Punctually is (g) ----- key (h) ----- success. We all (i) ------ be punctual (j)---- our day-to-day life.",
        "solution": "(a) great; (b) student/boy/girl; (c) late/irregular; (d) will/always; (e) a; (f) well/better; (g) the; (i) should/must/ought to; (j) in.",
        "explanation": "The sentence contrasts the consequences of lateness with the benefits of timely study, so words like \"student\" and \"late\" fit because a late pupil misses parts of lessons and therefore often lags behind, while verbs like \"prepare/study\" and the adverb \"well\" show that timely study leads to good exam results. \"Punctuality is the key to success\" is a fixed, grammatical phrase—hence \"the\" and \"to\" fit those blanks—and the final advice uses \"should\" and \"in\" to form \"We all should be punctual in our day-to-day life.\" Choose words that both make grammatical sense and follow the logical cause–effect sequence: lateness → missed learning → poor performance; punctuality → timely preparation → success.",

        "question": "Once there lived (a) —- poor man. He could hardly maintain his family (b) —- he did not have any land (c) —- cultivation. One day he bought (d) —- wonderful goose. The goose laid a (e) —- egg everyday. In a few months he became rich. But he was a (f) —- greedy man. He thought that there (g) —- more eggs in the belly of the goose. He wanted to get all the eggs (h) —- a time. So one day, he killed the goose and cut its belly open with (i) —- knife. But alas! there was no egg. Thus the greedy farmer (j) —- the useful goose.",
        "solution": "(a) a; (b) because; (c) for/of; (d) a; (e) golden; (f) very; (g) were/would be; (h) at; (i) a; (j) lost/killed.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: 'a' is used before singular countable nouns, so (a), (d) and (i) are \"a poor man\", \"a wonderful goose\", \"a knife\". 'Because' gives the reason in (b), 'for' shows purpose in (c) (\"land for cultivation\"), 'golden' describes the egg in (e), and 'very' intensifies 'greedy' in (f). 'Were' agrees with the plural 'eggs' in (g), 'at' completes the phrase \"at a time\" in (h), and 'killed' correctly describes the action done to the goose in (j).",
