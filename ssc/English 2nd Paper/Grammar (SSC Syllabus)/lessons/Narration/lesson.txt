        "solution": "Shabab asked Tahsin if he (T) had visited the Shat Gambuj Mosque. Tahsin replied in the negative saying that he (T) hadn't visited the Shat Gambuj Mosque. Then Shabab said that he (S) had been there the previous week. He then exclaimed in wonder that the mosque was very beautiful. After that Tahsin proposed that they should go there the following year.",
        "explanation": "Explanation: In reported speech the past simple question \"Did you visit...?\" becomes past perfect, so it becomes \"Shabab asked Tahsin if he had visited the Shat Gombuj Mosque.\" Negative reply \"No, I didn't\" is reported as \"he said he hadn't.\" Shahab's \"I visited there last week\" becomes \"he said he had visited it the previous week,\" and the exclamation \"How beautiful the mosque is!\" becomes \"how beautiful the mosque was.\" \"Let's go there next year\" is a suggestion, reported as \"Tahsin suggested they should go there the following year\" or \"Tahsin said they would go there the following year.\"",

        "question": "“Dear friend, which book do you want?” “A Practical English Grammar’ of A. J. Thomson. I lost my copy yesterday,” said Oishe. “I can lend you. But return it in a week,” I said.",
        "solution": "Addressing Oishe as dear friend, I asked her which book she wanted. She replied that she wanted A Practical English Grammar' of A.J. Thomson. She added that she had lost her copy the day before yesterday. Then I told her that I could lend her, and also told her to return it in a week.",
        "explanation": "Use \"I can lend it to you\" because \"lend\" normally takes a thing as a direct object; if you don’t name the thing you must say \"it\" (or include the object, e.g. \"I can lend you my copy\"). The book title should be marked (e.g. 'A Practical English Grammar') and the author is introduced with \"by\" rather than \"of\". In direct speech, when a sentence is followed by a reporting tag (like \"said Oishe\" or \"I said\"), replace the final full stop with a comma inside the closing quote: \"I can lend it to you, but return it in a week,\" I said.",

        "solution": "Drawing the attention of the rickshawpuller I asked him if he would go. The rickshawpuller asked me where I would go. I replied that I wanted to go to the railway station. The rickshawpuller told me that he might go, if I paid him 200 taka.",
        "explanation": "The rickshaw‑puller asks “Where?” to learn the destination, and when told “railway station” he replies he will go only if paid 200 taka—so the correct answer (that he demanded fare) follows directly from his conditional reply. This teaches reading dialogue by noting questions that ask for information and responses that state conditions or requests.",

Then Mona told her mother that she had to buy her (Mona) a good doll. Mother agreed with her.",
        "explanation": "The correct indirect-speech version uses backshifting of tenses, changes exclamations to \"exclaimed\" or \"said\" and shifts time/place words (e.g., \"tomorrow\" → \"the next day\").

I’ll buy it,” becomes Mona exclaimed that the doll was lovely and that she would buy it; Mother’s “Tomorrow we’ll visit another village fair” becomes she said they would visit the next day and urged them to go then. Imperatives like “Let’s go now” become suggestions or urgings (she told them to go), and direct requests like “You must buy me a good doll” become Mona insisted that her mother must/should buy her a good doll, with the short reply “Yes” reported as agreement.",
