        "question": "mr. hasan is a renowned english teacher has been teaching in our school for the past five years he is honest and sincere he is our favourite teacher we love him much",
        "solution": "Mr. Hasan is a renowned English teacher; has been teaching in our school for the past five years. He is honest and sincere. He is our favourite teacher. We love him much.\n\n[Note: In a compound sentence if there is no coordinating conjunction, we can use (;) instead of coordinating conjunction. Ref: Wren and Martin]",
        "explanation": "Correct sentence: \"Mr. Hasan is a renowned English teacher. He has been teaching in our school for the past five years. He is honest and sincere. He is our favourite teacher; we love him very much.\" Capitalization is needed for the title and proper noun (\"Mr.\", \"Hasan\") and the language name (\"English\"), sentences must be separated with proper punctuation, and \"very much\" is the natural idiom rather than \"much.\"",

        "explanation": "Explanation: In direct speech, each speaker’s words are enclosed in quotation marks and any question marks, exclamation marks or periods that end the spoken sentence go inside the quotes; reporting verbs like \"said\" or \"replied\" are separated from the quote by a comma when the quote continues and the quoted sentence begins with a capital letter. Hence the sentence is correctly punctuated as: I said to the old man, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"I am watching the boy swimming in the pond.\" He added, \"How happy they are! May Allah bless them. Let me sit by you and enjoy the scene.\"",

        "explanation": "The corrected version is right because it uses quotation marks to show spoken words, capital letters for names and sentence beginnings, and correct punctuation marks (question mark for questions, comma before a reporting clause, exclamation for strong feeling). It also uses apostrophes in contractions (e.g., \"haven't\") and places each speaker’s words as a separate sentence followed by the reporting phrase (e.g., \"asked Ratul\", \"said Nabil\").",

        "explanation": "The correct version capitalizes the sentence start and proper names and puts Lucy’s spoken words in quotation marks with a question mark because she is asking a question. Commas are used to set off the introductory clause and the speech tag, and commas/conjunctions join the narrator’s actions to avoid a run‑on sentence.",
