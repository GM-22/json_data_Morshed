        "explanation": "Use 'smoking' (a gerund) because we need the noun for the habit; 'dangerous' (b), 'harmful' (c) and 'costly' (d) are the adjective forms that correctly describe the habit and its effects. 'Smoker' (e) names the person who smokes, 'in public' (f) is the proper prepositional phrase, 'pollution' (g) is the noun from 'pollute', and 'numerous' (h) is the correct adjective meaning many. 'Respiratory' (i) is the adjective relating to breathing, and 'unaware' (j) correctly shows people who do not know the bad effects.",

        "explanation": "Explanation: The blanks are filled by changing the root words into the grammatical form required by the sentence using common suffixes and prefixes: use [-er] to form agent nouns (teach → teachers), [-ion]/[-ation] to make abstract nouns (inform → information; devote → devotion), [-ful]/[-ive] to make adjectives (resource → resourceful; inform → informative), and [-ship], [-ity], [-ence]/[-ance] to make friendship, popularity, dependence respectively. Use the negative prefix im- with an adjective-forming suffix to negate a root when needed (measure → immeasurable). Choosing these forms makes the sentence grammatically correct because each blank requires either a noun, adjective, or agent noun that matches the surrounding words.",

        "explanation": "Most blanks are filled by adding suffixes or prefixes to make the root word the correct part of speech: adjectives use endings like -ous/-ious (study → studious) or -ful (mindful, helpful, dutiful, respectful, truthful), -ive (creative); adverbs use -ly (polite → politely); nouns use -ity/-ness (punctual → punctuality, sincere → sincerity, honest → honesty); the negative prefix in- makes inattentive; and -ing or -er give verbal/adjectival forms (thinking, riser). Choose the form that fits the sentence grammar (adjective before a noun, adverb after “behaves,” noun after “benefit of,” negative with in- when expressing “not”).",

We should use electricity (d) — (honest) and (e) —(frugal) and should create (f) — (aware) among people to solve this (g) — (nation) problem.

        "explanation": "Use the correct word forms: adverbs modify verbs so (a) \"seriously\" (hampered), (d) \"honestly\" and (e) \"frugally\" (use electricity), and (i) the verb \"upgrade\" (improve power stations). Adjectives describe nouns so (c) \"industrial\", (g) \"national\", and (h) \"effective\" are needed, while noun forms express states or problems so (b) \"difficulties\" and (f) \"awareness\" fit best.

        "explanation": "Choose the form that fits the grammar: noun where a thing is needed, adjective/adverb where something is described, and verb where an action is meant. For example, (a) \"education\" is a noun (the aim of something), (b) \"useful\" is an adjective after \"be\", (c) \"truly\" is an adverb modifying \"educated\", (d) \"personal\", (e) \"thoughtful\", (f) \"truthful\", (g) \"dutiful\" and (h) \"prosperous\" are adjectives describing nouns, (i) \"remove\" is the verb meaning \"take away\", and (j) \"self-reliance\" is a noun. Changing roots with the right prefixes/suffixes makes them the correct parts of speech and keeps the sentence grammatically correct.",
