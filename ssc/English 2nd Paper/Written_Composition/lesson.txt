        "question": "Write a paragraph on \"Tree Plantation\" in your own words.",
        "solution": "Nowadays 'tree plantation' has become a much ventilated issue. 'Tree plantation' means planting trees in a large number to prevent deforestation. The importance of tree plantation beggars description. Firstly, trees provide us with various fruits, honey, fodder for animals, and medicine. Secondly, they supply timber which is used in housing, in making furniture, toys and vehicles, and in manufacturing paper and pencils. Thirdly. almost all the birds and many animals depend on trees for their habitat. Fourthly, trees play the key-role in protecting our environment and maintaining ecological balance. They prevent erosion of soil and protect houses from flood and storm. They absorb carbon-di-oxide, a major culprit for green-house effect. They help rain to occur. Random felling of trees may cause rapid desertification. In recent times, the importance of tree plantation is being desperately felt because our environment is facing increasing threats day by day.. Temperature is ever on the rise; polar ice is melting and sea-level is rising; yield of crops are collapsing and so on. July and August are the best time for tree plantation. To motivate people for tree plantation, mass-. awareness should be raised. Fallow or unused land available anywhere namely roadsides, sea-beaches. riversides, different institutions etc. can be brought under tree plantation. To conclude, every possible step should be taken for tree plantation until it is too late.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph correctly emphasizes that tree plantation provides oxygen, shade, habitat for wildlife, and helps control soil erosion and air pollution, because these are the primary benefits trees offer to people and the environment. It also mentions simple actions—selecting suitable species, planting properly, and regular watering—so students understand how plantation leads to those benefits. The underlying concept is that trees are living systems that support ecosystems and human well‑being by cycling nutrients, storing carbon, and regulating local climate.",

There are no adequate number of tables and benches. They cannot accommodate all the students. As a result, many students have to stand while eating. The room is not kept neat and tidy. This creates a rather unpleasant atmosphere for the students.. Moreover, it does not provide us with good tiffin. The foods and drinks are not covered. On the contrary, the foods sold at the canteen are expensive. The menu is the same every day. The waiters are rude and arrogant. They often shout at students. So. I therefore, pray and hope that you would be kind enough to take necessary steps to resolve the current state soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMd. Kamrul Hossain\n\nOn behalf of the students of Rajnagor High School",

        "solution": "A winter morning, so to say, represents the entire winter. Dense fog and biting cold characterise a typical winter morning. Dense fog hides the beautiful scenario of sunrise and keeps on fighting against the sun-rays. Nature looks hazy and the situation goes on until it is well past morning or, sometimes, nearly noon. As a result even things at a little distance can hardly be seen, let alone things at a great distance. A few birds chirp and charm us. Animals also fall victim to the extreme cold. They come out late. People in towns and villages behave differently in a winter morning. Village people usually get up early while urban people rise late. Unlike urban people, village people gather straw and dry leaves and make fire to warm themselves. People busk in the sun in villages while it is a rare phenomenon in towns. In a winter morning, children are the early-risers. People wear warm clothes according to their affordability. The poor suffer a lot. In a winter morning, people enjoy delicious cakes, date-juice, 'payes' of date-juice and many other tasty food-items. When the sun rises. dew-drops in grass or on leaves of trees glitter, fog disappears, temperature increases and thus the morning enters into midday. I like a winter morning because it is unique and different from the morning of the other seasons and with all its merits and demerits it is worth enjoying.",

They often taunt and tease college going youths especially the girls, hijack various vehicles, cheat the shopkeepers, give no fare to the rickshaw-pullers and behave roughly towards people and passers-by. Things turn worse after the sunset. They gather at the intersections of roads and footpaths. Then they take forbidden drugs and heroin and also sell them. They prey on passers-by and snatch away their money. So, we are always panic stricken. We are seeking your kind measures to get rid of this crisis.\n\n1, therefore, pray and hope that you would be kind enough to take necessary steps to ensure the safety for the people. May this problem be taken up to save us from the panic.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nShibbir Ahmad\n\nOn behalf of the people of Rahimanagar, Chandpur",
        "explanation": "Writing a formal complaint letter to the Superintendent of Police is correct because the SP has the authority to direct police action and a written complaint creates an official record that can trigger investigation. In the letter you should clearly state incidents with dates, locations, and any evidence or witnesses, describe how public safety is affected, and request specific actions (patrols, arrests, etc.). Use a polite, formal tone, give your contact details for follow-up, and keep a copy for future reference.",

        "solution": "A rickshaw puller is a poor day labourer. He earns his livelihood by pulling the rickshaw. He is a familiar figure in our country. Generally he lives in a slum area. He carries passengers and goods from one place to another on payment. He hires a rickshaw from the owner on daily basis. There are a few who pull their own rickshaws. A rickshaw puller works from dawn to dusk and even to the later part of the night. He has to pull the rickshaw in the sun and in the rain. He is generally gentle by nature. But sometimes he demands high fare. He feels tired but cannot take rest. He has to live from hand to mouth as he earns too little to support his family. Sometimes his family passes the day with a little food. He leads a miserable life in a slum area. In spite of all these odd condition, he feels proud to live on his fair earnings from his sweat. So, we should show due respect to a rickshawpuller.",

        "question": "Write a paragraph about \"A Winter Morning\".",
        "solution": "A winter morning, so to say, represents the entire winter. Dense fog and biting cold characterise a typical winter morning. Dense fog hides the beautiful scenario of sunrise and keeps on fighting against the sun-rays. Nature looks hazy and the situation goes on until it is well past morning or, sometimes, nearly noon. As a result even things at a little distance can hardly be seen, let alone things at a great distance. A few birds chirp and charm us. Animals also fall victim to the extreme cold. They come out late. People in towns and villages behave differently in a winter morning. Village people usually get up early while urban people rise late. Unlike urban people, village people gather straw and dry leaves and make fire to warm themselves. People busk in the sun in villages while it is a rare phenomenon in towns. In a winter morning, children are the early-risers. People wear warm clothes according to their affordability. The poor suffer a lot. In a winter morning, people enjoy delicious cakes, date-juice, 'payes' of date-juice and many other tasty food-items. When the sun rises, dew-drops in grass or on leaves of trees glitter, fog disappears, temperature increases and thus the morning enters into midday. I like a winter morning because it is unique and different from the morning of the other seasons and with all its merits and demerits it is worth enjoying.",
        "explanation": "The paragraph is effective because it clearly describes the key elements of a winter morning—cold air, pale light, frost or mist, and a hushed atmosphere—using simple sensory details. It helps students learn descriptive writing by showing a clear topic sentence, supporting vivid details (sight, sound, temperature), and a final impression so readers can easily picture the scene.",

Use simple formatting, active language, quantify achievements if possible, and proofread to present a professional and trustworthy application.",

        "solution": "A book fair has nowadays become very popular. In a book fair various types of books are displayed and sold. Every year a large book fair is held at the premises of Bangla Academy. It is called 'Ekushey Boi Mela'. This year I visited the fair. It was well decorated with banners, festoons, etc. As I approached the fair, the memory of the martyrs of the language movement peeped into my mind. There I found numerous stalls displaying books on different subjects namely fiction, text book, drama, novel, poetry, science, and so on. People of all ages and classes came to enjoy the fair. I bought some books on literature namely Nazrul's 'Bisher Banshi'. Tagore's 'Naukadubi', Jasim Uddin's 'Shojon Badiar Ghat' etc. Many literary persons attended the fair and increased the charm. Luckily, I managed to take autographs of some of them. In the afternoon a seminar on the language movement was held. At last a cultural function took place. Many famous artists attended the function. They entertained us with melodious songs, recital of poems and so on. I enjoyed the patriotic songs most. They inspired me to vow to serve the country and countrymen. I enjoyed the fair very much.",
        "explanation": "A good paragraph about \"Your Visit to a Book Fair\" is correct when it clearly states the setting, main events, and your personal reaction so readers understand what happened and why it mattered. Include specific details (types of books, stalls, activities) and arrange them in a simple sequence (arrival, highlights, purchases, feelings) to keep the narrative coherent. Use vivid but concise language and end with a brief reflection or takeaway to complete the paragraph.",

        "solution": "A national flag is a symbol of an independent country. Bangladesh is an independent country. So we have a national flag of our own. It symbolizes our integrity, solidarity' and sovereignty. Our national flag represents our national identity in the whole world. We got our national flag at the cost of a bloody war in 1971. It is rectangular in shape. The ratio of the length and the width of the flag is 10: 6. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The red colour symbolizes the blood of the martyrs and the green symbolizes the ever green land of this country. Late artist Qamrul Hassan designed it. It was first raised on the premises of the University of Dhaka on the 2nd March 1971. It is hoisted everyday on our government offices and educational institutions. It is kept half-mast on our national mourning days. To show due respect and honour to our national flag is our bounden duty. So we should uphold its honour by doing our work honestly and sincerely.\n\nSelected Vocabulary (নির্বাচিত শব্দার্থ) : Independent -স্বাধীন; rectangular -আয়তক্ষেত্রাকার; symbolize -প্রতীকায়িত করা; martyr -শহিদ: hoist -উত্তোলন করা; premise -চত্ত্বর, প্রাঙ্গণ; represent -তুলে ধরা, প্রতিনিধিত্ব করা; bounden -আবশ্যক, বিবেক নির্দেশিত: late- মৃত, প্রয়াত, দেরিতে; ratio -অনুপাত; symbol -প্রতীক; sovereignty-সার্বভৌমত্ব; own-নিজস্ব: integrity-অখণ্ডতা, সততা, সাধুতাঃ solidarity-সংহতি; identity-পরিচয়; in the whole world-সারা বিশ্বে; at the cost of-বিনিময়ে, মূল্যে; bloody war-রক্তক্ষয়ী যুদ্ধ; shape- আকার, আকৃতি; length-দৈঘ্য width-প্রন্থ; major part-প্রধান অংশ; deep green-গাঢ় সবুজ; red circle-লাল বৃত্ত; middle-মাঝখান: blood-রক্ত; design-নকশা করা; half-mast-অর্ধ নমিত; national mourning day-জাতীয় শোক দিবস; respect-সম্মান, সম্মান করা; honour- সম্মান; uphold-সমুন্নত রাখা; honestly-সভাবে; sincerely-আন্তরিকতার সাথে।'",

Moreover, the roads have been damaged due to excessive movement of vehicles before. As a result, the motor vehicles cannot move without the risk of accident. It is very difficult for us to go along the damaged roads. The students and people going to their schools, offices, shops, and other places are suffering a lot. And the patients are the worst sufferers from it. People often fall down and get injured. The sufferings of the common people beggar description. They are totally disconnected because of the damaged roads. Letters, money orders, and other documents sent through the post office and courier service have remained undelivered for days. Many job-seeking youths cannot receive their letters of various kinds in due time owing to late delivery.\n\nTherefore, I pray and hope that you would take necessary steps to repair the damaged roads immediately and oblige us thereby.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nKarim/Kabit\n\nOn behalf of the people of Polashpur\n\nDinajpur City Corporation,",

        "question": "Write a paragraph on \"A street hawker\" within 200 words.",
        "solution": "A street hawker is a commonly sighted person in the streets of big cities and towns. A hawker sells his goods with interesting cries in order to draw the attention of his customers. He knows the art of convincing. Women and children are usually attracted by his calls. He generally offers toys, fruits, biscuits, vegetables, ice-creams, cakes, laces, cloths, utensils etc. On the contrary, there are other kinds of hawkers who buy newspapers, blank pots and old books. Carrying the goods for sale in his hands or over his shoulders, he moves from door to door. Sometimes he goes from one street to another with his moving shop and he often causes problems on the foot- path. A street hawker's income is not sufficient. So he has to maintain his family through hardship.",
        "explanation": "A good paragraph on \"A street hawker\" is correct when it opens with a clear topic sentence that identifies who the hawker is and what they do, follows with 2–3 supporting sentences giving concrete details (appearance, goods sold, daily routine, challenges, and interaction with customers), and ends with a brief concluding sentence that reflects the hawker’s role or significance. This structure helps readers form a vivid, coherent picture while keeping the writing focused and within the 200-word limit. Use simple language and sensory details so the paragraph is easy to read and emotionally engaging.",

It shares messages, opinions, or protests in creative ways. During the July Revolution in 2024, graffiti became a powerful tool for students to express their feelings and emotions. After a student activist, Abu Sayeed, was killed in Rangpur during the quota movement, a mural appeared with the words, &quot;Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?&quot; Although it was removed the next day, it inspired many.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nUndoubtedly, graffiti became a strong way to protest during the anti-discrimination movement. It was used to fight against the dictatorial government, which ruled for over 15 years. The movement began when students demanded changes to the quota system in government jobs. As the protests grew, graffiti became a strong weapon for the students. Walls in cities were filled with colorful pictures and writings. These artworks showed anger, hope, and unity. They carried strong messages against injustice, corruption and oppression. Some famous slogans were &quot;Quota Na Medha?&quot; and &quot;Bullet Diye Biplob Thame Na.&quot; The graffiti helped to give a voice to those who were silenced by the regime.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe protests became stronger after students at Dhaka University were attacked by government forces. Graffiti was a way to show their anger and demand change. Students and others painted murals in Dhaka and other cities. These murals became symbols of resistance. It turned every wall into a canvas for their defiance. The artwork also created solidarity among various groups who were victim of social and economic division.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAfter falling down the govt. on 5 August 2024, graffiti spread across the country. Students painted walls to honor martyrs and support the revolution. Symbols like clenched fists and the rising sun were common. Even rickshaw pullers and artists joined in it. They donated money and effort. The once-silenced voices now echoed through the streets. The power of visual expression solidified the movements legacy.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nGraffiti became the voice of the July Revolution of 2024. It reminded people of their power to fight against injustice and create change. This art continues to inspire freedom and strength in Bangladesh.",

Trees are our best friend. We depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen which is very essential for our existence. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for some quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nFirst, it is important to know what trees do for us. Man needs oxygen. In every breath we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus, they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food, clothes, shelter, medicine and shades. We cannot live without the help of trees.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nBut, at present, people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting down them mainly for firewood and furniture. Everyday our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nTropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. Unfortunately, at present, they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, &#39;Greenhouse Effect&#39; has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Ice is melting in the South and North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. We should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop cutting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable.",

Increase of temperature and natural disasters are the result of climate change. Due to increasing concentrations of Greenhouse Gases, our climate is expected to change even more in the coming decades.

This is mainly because\u003Cbr /\u003E\nof the geographical location of our country, making it highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Bangladesh has a flat, low lying landscape and lack of institutional setup. Climate change is becoming a crucial issue to us and to our government as well. More than 80% of the land is prone to flooding. About two-thirds of our population is engaged in agriculture. So climate change will affect the farmers immensely. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says, Bangladesh would experience a net increase in poverty of 15% by 2030 due to climate change. 17% people of the country will need to be relocated if global warming persists at the present rate. 81% migrants in Dhaka&#39;s slums reported a climate-related issue for displacement. It has been predicted that there will be 3 to 10 million internal migrants in Bangladesh over the next 40 years. According to the World Bank, climate change will cost Bangladesh USD 121 billion during 2005-2050, or USD 3 billion annually, unless measures are taken.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThis natural disaster brings floods, cyclones, storms, extreme temperature and drought into the country. Mostly, the northern regions of Bangladesh suffer due to extreme temperature problem.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe World Bank warns Bangladesh of becoming the country worst hit by climate change by the year 2100. A WB report estimates that the sea level will rise by 3 feet. This will cause huge flooding and the failing of crops in the country. This will cause poverty and inflation.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSo, it can be said that we are already paying the price of climate change. If we dont build consciousness and become aware, we will be in great danger in the near future.",

Heavy monsoon rain began to fall around mid-August and then continued pouring for days. This caused the water level of the rivers to rise and overflow. The situation worsened when India released water from the dams in Tripura. It triggered the floodwaters to increase dangerously. The floods affected 11 districts in north-eastern and south-eastern Bangladesh, including Noakhali, Cumilla, Lakshmipur and Chattogram. A total of 73 upazilas and 528 unions were severely impacted.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe rising water damaged homes, roads, schools, and farms. It affected more than 5.8 million people all over the country. People had to leave their homes seeking safety. Many of them took shelter in evacuation shelters. On the other hand, many had to leave the city and move in with their relatives. Still, a great number of people remained trapped in their houses in the affected areas, waiting to be rescued. For many consecutive days, there was also no electricity, gas or mobile network. People started running out of their rations and safe drinking water.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe floodwaters also ruined agricultural fields, fishponds and livestock, causing millions of dollars in damage. A significant amount of crops were destroyed. It make the life harder for farmers. Contaminated water led to a serious health crisis as well, with a concerning outbreak of waterborne diseases.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nA few days later, India released even more water from the Farakka Barrage. It worsened the situation in districts like Noakhali and Feni. By the end of August, the rain stopped and the floodwater slowly began to go down. However, it took time for everything to return to normal.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nDuring this crisis, the government, army, navy, Fire Service, students, and various organizations like the As-Sunnah Foundation worked hard to help the flood victims. Many NGOs and volunteers provided food, clean water and medical help. Foreign countries also offered support. Citizens across Bangladesh supported relief efforts by donating money, clothes, dry food, medicine and other necessary items to help the flood victims. Despite the hardships, the people of Bangladesh showed strength and unity. They helped each other rebuilding their lives.",

The station offered a scene of great activities. Rickshaws, motor cars, etc. were coming to the station with passengers. Coolies were running behind them. There was a long queue before the ticket counter.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nI managed to take my seat beside the window to enjoy the natural sights. At 7 a.m., the guard blew the whistle and the train started moving towards the destination and our journey began. The train first moved slowly, then it geared up quickly. Fresh wind began to enter the compartment. I began to enjoy beautiful sights. Every sight impressed me. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. In the train, it seemed to me that we were not moving but the trees, houses and other things outside the train were moving backwards speedily. In fact, the train was moving but they were still. I was charmed by this. Some were gossiping, some were sleeping in the compartment. Hawkers were selling their goods shouting their unique voice.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWe enjoyed gossiping with our fellow travellers. Our train touched at few big stations and we bought boiled eggs, bananas and green coconuts and also some magazines. When we were in Chattogram, we saw many hills which gave me much delight.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAt last, the train reached Chattogram Railway Station at 1.00 p.m. We got down from the train and saw my cousin waiting at the station. He had come to receive us. He became very pleased to see us.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe journey by train gave me much pleasure and experience. I wish I could make it again. Its memory will last in my mind as long as I live.",

They have brought almost the whole world into our living room. Satellite TV is such an invention of modern science. It is a very effective medium of recreation. The programmes shown by various channels are very attractive. Desire to know the unknown and to see the unseen is really fulfilled by the satellite TV channels. Channels of foreign countries help us to know the culture, tradition, etc, of those countries. Through satellite channels, we can get the current news of the world. Some channels telecast up-to-date news of the world and through documentary channels, we can learn numerous things.&nbsp;\u003Cbr /\u003E\nBut sometimes, some channels telecast programmes which affect the viewers, specially our young generation, very adversely. Because of the influence of satellite TV channels, youths of our country are gradually being exposed to western values and modes of life. They are blindly following those. Forgetting their own culture,&nbsp;they are adopting the foreign culture. This is really a threat to our own culture and tradition.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSometimes, they get so addicted to these channels that they spend more time in watching TV and neglect their studies. Consequently, they become lazy and good-for-nothing. These satellite channels are destroying the creativity of the youngsters and guiding them in the wrong way as they are more interested in watching fashion shows and musical shows and very few watch education-related programmes,\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAgain, some channels telecast indecent programmes, which leave very bad impact on their mind. Obscene and immoral films, dramas or music videos are influencing young generation. Indeed, violent films are often making young people aggressive and quarrelsome. These are the reasons of moral degradation and tremendous increase of social crime in our country.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nTherefore, the government should put some restrictions on the telecast of the satellite TV channels. Guardians should encourage their children to watch the channels which telecast educational programmes. We must motivate our youths to take the good things from satellite TV channels and avoid the bad things. Family and educational institutions can play a major role in this regard.",

We can do anything with the help of modern science.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nOur agricultural and industrial development is fully dependent on modern science. We now cultivate our land with power-tillers. The production of crops is increasing day by day with the help of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Science also helps us in inventing new hybrid seeds. In industrial areas all the industries run with the knowledge and help of science. From needles to rockets, everything produced in industry is the contribution of science.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWe see the influence of science at every step of our life. It has changed the mode of our life. It has created many things for our comfort. Science today has taken the possession of the world. The pen we write with, the shirt we put on, the bicycle we ride all are the contributions of science. Electricity has worked wonders.

Cinema, tape recorder, CD, VCD and DVD players, satellite TV, etc. are some remarkable gifts of science for our recreation.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nScience has done a lot in diagnosing and treating patients. X-ray, CT scan, ultrasonography, ECG, biopsy, various life-saving antibiotics, etc. are the wonderful gifts of science. Modern medical science has given eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, legs to the lame and what not.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nScience has made the world smaller and faster. Buses, trains, aeroplanes, etc. can take us from one place to another within a short period of time. Computer and internet are the greatest wonders of modern science. They are doing various difficult tasks for us within a very short time.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSometimes, science becomes a curse. Science is for the benefit of mankind but out of selfish motive man misuses science and brings untold sufferings. Some scientists have invented some dreadful weapons. Tanks, missiles, torpedoes, atom and hydrogen bombs can easily destroy the world in a moment.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe invention of science is to do good to human beings. Science brings happiness and prosperity. But if it is misused, it may bring destruction.",

Now, over-population is a great problem for our country.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nPopulation explosion is destroying all the efforts for our development. Our population is increasing day by day but the land is not increasing. Our land is fixed. Other facilities for living also are not increasing in proportion to the increase of population. So, the problems of shelter, food, clothing, medical treatment, housing, education, entertainment, etc. are increasing gradually. It also causes various disturbances in the society. Because of it, everything is becoming bad to worst. So, various socio-economic and political problems are created for population explosion in Bangladesh.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWe must come forward to control our population.

They think that their sons will help them. This wrong idea should be removed to control population. Besides, people living in rural areas are religiously fundamental.

They are summer, rainy, autumn, late autumn, winter and spring. Every season has its unique features. Of all these seasons I like the spring most. This season consists of the Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra. It is the best, the loveliest and the most charming of all the seasons. It is called the king of all seasons. It is the last of six seasons in Bangladesh. There are some specific reasons why I like the spring most.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nTo me, the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings to the people. The autumn and the late autumn have also more or less disadvantages like the summer, rainy and winter seasons. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWith the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. The spring season gives a fresh start and new lives to the trees which shed their leaves in winter. Everything in the nature looks fresh. The sky looks clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves. The flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard everywhere. The melodious songs of the cuckoo sooth our mind. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People also enjoy a better health. Besides, during this time, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available in our country.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe season has a few disadvantages, too. During this season, some people suffer from diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox, etc.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn spite of its few disadvantages, its positive aspects are overwhelming. The convenience it offers fascinates all. Thats why, I like the spring season most.",

They are the devotees in the temple of learning. So, the most important duty of students is to study seriously with devotion. It does not mean that they are isolated from the society. They are also social beings like other classes of people. They enjoy the same social benefits, rights and privileges. So, as members of society, they have certain duties to the society in which they live in. There are many kinds of social services and students have a lot to do in these sectors.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nLiving in a developing country like ours, students must render some social services for the development and welfare of the nation. So during the long vacation and leisure time, students can open night schools and teach the illiterate working children and adult people. They can also teach the farmers about the modern methods of cultivation, the use of fertilizers and proper caring of crops. They can also suggest them to dig a pond for fish cultivation or to make a farm.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nStudents can render immense service in the field of health. The village people and the people living in the slums have no knowledge about health, nutrition and sanitation. The students can teach them about the basic rules of health, nutrition and sanitation. Female students can also teach the uneducated women how to keep their houses neat and clean, how to bring up children and look after their health.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nStudents can prove themselves to be worthy citizens during natural disasters.

It refers to 5 August 2024, a day of great change and a historic moment for the people of Bangladesh. On this day, the autocrate regime, which lasted over 15 years, collapsed. In this way, the dictatorship came to an end. The then Prime Minister, had to resign and flee the country because of a mass uprising.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe events leading to &#39;36 July&#39; began earlier in June 2024. On 5 June, the High Court Division restored the quota system in government jobs. This decision upset the general students, who wanted reforms in the system. As a result, they began their protest. By 16 July, the situation turned violent as the government tried to suppress the movement. Law enforcement agencies were deployed to suppress the students. They fired bullets at students and innocent people, charged with batons and detained the protesters, but could not stop them from protesting. On 21 July, the Supreme Court supported the demand for quota reform. However, the protesters had more demands. They sought justice for the killings during the protests, which they referred to as the &#39;July Massacre&#39;. To put emphasis on the continuation of the protest, the students started counting the days of July beyond its usual 31 days. For them, 1 August became &#39;32 July&#39;, and this counting continued.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe protest grew stronger. On 4 August, the protesters announced a non-cooperation movement, naming the day &#39;35 July&#39;. The next day, 5 August, was marked as &#39;36 July&#39;. On this day, thousands of people marched to Dhaka from different parts of Bangladesh. The mass uprising forced the then Prime Minister to resign and flee the country. The protesters called their success the &#39;Second Independence&#39; or &#39;Rebirth Day&#39;.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe term 36 July is now a symbol of unity and courage. It appears in murals, graffiti and art across the country. It reminds us of the peoples power and shows that unity and bravery can bring about meaningful change.",

It is called the mirror of the world. Sitting in our room, we can know the situation of the world. The news of social, economic, cultural and political situations of a country is published in newspapers. By reading newspapers, the people of a country can also know the details of other countries of the world. So, newspaper is called the storehouse of knowledge.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nMany of us are very fond of reading newspapers. We cannot think of a single day without reading a newspaper. It is too much favourite an item for us. There are various types of news in it. It carries news from all sides and of all topics of the world. Choosing columns of different topics depends on ones own mentality. So, while reading newspapers, someone opens the first page and another the last one. There are the writings of the remarkable writers in it. It bears daily information, tragic scenes, news of development activities, remarkable incidents, weather forecast, and so on. It is said that newspapers are the scale to understand the standard of a nation.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe biggest advantage of reading a newspaper is that it adds value in our life. It improves our English or any other language in which we are reading in it. It enhances our confidence. It actually makes lives easier as we are updated with the current information around us. It also increases our reading skills and indirectly writing skills as well.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSometimes, many fabricated or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in society. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of the people. Otherwise, it might hamper national and international relations. In developing international relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various job advertisements. So, they are helpful in removing unemployment. The stories and novels published in newspapers give us much pleasure. So, considering all these, it can be said that reading newspapers is a must to cope with the changing world and be informed of current affairs.",

Like many people of this region, I love to enjoy this game very much. In fact, it has been my most favourite game and I don&#39;t miss any chance to enjoy it.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe most important reason for which I like this game is that a single match is full of occasions when the spectators get enthralled and excited. On the part of the batsmen, there are sixes and fours, Every boundary and over boundary gives the spectators so much excitement. Then, there are singles, twos, threes, etc. which also entertain the spectators greatly. On the part of the bowlers, there are inswings, outswings, yorkers, etc, and these things give much pleasure to the spectators. However, the most exciting event for the bowlers is the fall of wickets. Besides, the fielders also eentertain the spectators with extraordinary catches, breathtaking run-outs, and acrobatic body movement on the ground and even in the air.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSecondly, this game is termed as a game of uncertainty. This is a unique characteristic of any cricket match. Most often, none can say which team will win the match. When the match ends in the last over or in the last ball of the innings, the pleasures and excitement of winning team&#39;s players and the spectators know no bounds. Thirdly, it is also called the gentlemens game. The players are usually gentle, polite and very considerate in their behaviour. While in the other games, there are many incidents of physical conflicts between or among the players, in cricket, they usually stay far away from one another. Furthermore, the umpires in the field also stand in the field and can easily watch over any unwanted incidents among the players. As a result, players hardly involve in any conflict, let alone physical clashes.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nFinally, this game requires the players to work hard in a disciplined manner. They have to take regular physical exercise to maintain their fitness. So, they usually enjoy a sound health.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn conclusion, I take pride in being a fan of such a fantastic game like cricket. I not only enjoy watching cricket matches, but also love to play it with the local boys.",

I would like to choose a rural area as my working place.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nI would like to serve my country sincerely. The condition of English in our country is very poor. I would like to improve it. If our nation is capable enough to communicate internationally, she can easily reach her destination to prosperity. Though English is a foreign language, we hardly can do anything without it in this age. I shall teach my students the four skills of language listening, speaking, reading and writing within the shortest possible time.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nI pray to Allah for the success of my future plan. I have been studying heart and soul to build up a strong background of English in me. Apart from the school texts, I regularly go through English newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals, etc. to improve my stock of vocabulary. I hope I shall be able to translate my aim or future plan into reality by the grace of Almighty creator.",

In school the classes were not much interesting to me but the leisure period while we used to play various sports. I was a regular student in my class. So I was hardly beaten or scolded by my teachers for negligence to studies. After the school was over, in our way home, we used to play ha-du-du, hide and seek, gather plums or steal green mangoes from some trees and sometimes used to hath in stream. One day I along with my three friends went to a friend&#39;s house to eat green-plum. But as the tree was long, none of us dared to climb it up.

Science is inventing wonder after wonder and magic after magic like ALADINS magic lamp. It has made impossible possible. We feel the impact of science almost in every walk of our life. For example, computer has brought a great change in our life. Now we can do calculations with great speed and accuracy. It can process, manipulate, reproduce and communicate data at a very high speed. We cannot imagine life without computer.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn addition, computer is an electronic device used for storing and analyzing information fed into it, for calculating, or for controlling machinery automatically. They do automatic fine tuning and colour regulating on television sets and other household gadgets. In offices, computer is used to maintain records, files, prepare payrolls apart from performing various other functions. In hospital, computer is used to diagnose diseases. It helps in carrying out surgeries.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nMoreover, computer is rendering valuable service to the radars, missiles, rocket launching, automatic flights, etc. We have pilotless aeroplanes which are controlled by computers from the ground stations. Airlines and railways are now offering instant information on bookings with the help of computers. Computers help big business houses in carrying out their up-to-date business. Computers are widely used to solve climatic, industrial, commercial, financial and other complicated problems. In advanced countries, computers are used to regulate and control traffic.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nHowever, computer is not blessing in all. It has caused to create many problems. A computer can perform works of several people. It has increased the rate of unemployment. It has replaced scores of people. Often the mistakes made by computers are really blunders. Excessive dependence of man on computers have reduced mental efficiency in human beings. Internet is often used for mischievous intentions. They are used to send false e-mails for malicious intentions to harass the person. Some others try to view those websites that are not meant for them. This is a bad tendency and must be checked. Internet should be for development and other good purposes and not for destruction and decay.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nComputers have many shortcomings. However, their advantages far outweigh their disadvantages. They are integral part of modern life. We cannot think of life without computers.",

It is the computer-based global information system. By accessing to internet today, the vast treasure of all forms of knowledge, information, inventions, techniques, process, technologies, arts, literature etc. can be made available. It has made inroads into all walks of our life.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe internet is composed of many interconnected computer networks. Each network may link tens, hundreds and even thousands of computers, enabling them to share information with one another and to share computational resources such as powerful super computers and databases of information.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nToday through internet, people all over the world can communicate effectively and inexpensively with one another. Unlike traditional broadcasting media, such as radio and television, the internet does not have centralised distribution system.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn this world of globalisation and IT revolution, internet is the key player to make it happen so. The internet has brought about new opportunities to government, business and education. Government uses the internet for internal communication, distribution of information and automated tax processing. In Bangladesh, the use of internet has taken a leap in the last few years. The government of our country can take it as an aid to decision making process for each agency and ministry of the government. This can help bringing transparency in the very process of governance. In addition to offering goods and services on line to customers, business men use internet to connect with other business men. Today many individuals use the internet for shopping, paying bills and online banking. Educational institutions use the internet for research and to deliver courses to students on line at remote sites.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nNot to say, it has some abuses too. Nowadays especially the teen agers are very prone to absorb the demerits of internet. They sometimes keep chatting and whiling away their time with their friends or even unknown persons when they are supposed to be at their desk to study. They tend to enjoy pornography and do many immoral and hazardous tasks diving into dark webs. Thus, they are going away from their study and becoming morally degraded. In addition, sometimes criminal and terrorists take the advantage of internet to actualize their target. They exploit Cyber Cafe as their means of fulfilling their task. To belittle and derogate others, some heinous and immoral persons mail many messages and vulgar pictures to different addresses.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn fine, we should use internet sorting the best out of it so that we ourselves can be benefited and can benefit others too. To keep pace with the rest of the world in every sector, we must be connected with internet.",

It often delivers powerful messages, expressing opinions or protesting against injustices. Graffiti allows people to express their thoughts and emotions creatively. During the July Revolution of 2024 in our country, graffiti became a vital tool for protest. After the assassination of a student activist named Abu Sayeed in Rangpur, students painted a mural with the words, &quot;Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?&quot; Although the mural was removed the next morning, it left a lasting impression. After the fall of the dictatorial government on 5 August 2024, graffiti spread across Bangladesh. Students painted walls to honor martyrs and support the revolution. Slogans appeared on walls in Dhaka and other parts of the country, alongside symbols like clenched fists and the rising sun. Graffiti became a way to exercise freedom of speech and draw attention to ignored issues. Students, artists, and even rickshaw pullers joined the movement, with donations supporting their efforts. Graffiti has since become a voice for the people, symbolizing hope and unity.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E art (n.) - শিল্প; express (v.) - ব্যস্ত করা; injustice (n.) - অবিচার; thoughts (n.) - চিন্তা-চেতনা; vital (adj.) - অপরিহার্য; protest (n.) - প্রতিবাদ; assassination (n.) - হত্যা; mural (n.) - দেয়ালচিত্র; impression (n.) - ছাপ; doctorial (adj.) - স্বৈরাচার; revolution (n.) - বিপ্লব; clenched (adj.) - মুষ্টিবন্ধ; fist (n.) - মুষ্টি; freedom of speech (phr.) - বাকস্বাধীনতা।",

Aedes mosquitos are responsible for the transmission of this virus. The virus easily spreads from people to mosquitos and from mosquitos to people. Once a person is affected by this virus, a mosquito bearing no germs of dengue can be loaded up with the virus while biting the infected person. After that, if the mosquito bites a healthy person, it transmits the virus to him. The infected person usually shows the symptoms within 4 to 12 days of being infected. The symptoms include high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint pain, rash, etc. Once someone is infected by the virus and starts to show the symptoms of dengue fever, immediate actions should be taken. Otherwise, it may lead the person to the risk of death. Some factors are responsible for the rising number of dengue cases in Bangladesh, such as global warming leading to a rise in global temperature, increased level of humidity, and finally, greater quantity of rainfall causing more pools of stagnant water to be formed. Using insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and lortg pants, and controlling mosquitoes inside and outside your home are some common preventive measures that should be followed to stay safe from dengue.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E viral (adj.) - ভাইরাসঘটিত; disease (n.) - রোগ; transmission (n.) - সংক্রমণ; spread (v.) - ছড়িয়ে পড়া; infected (adj.) - সংক্রামিত; symptoms (n.) - লক্ষণ, উপসর্গ; nausea (n.) - বমি বমি ভাব; immediate action (phr.) - তাৎক্ষণিক কর্মপ্রক্রিয়া; risk of death (phr.) - মৃত্যুঝুঁকি; humidity (n.) - বাষ্প; greater quantity of rainfall (phr.) - ব্যপক পরিমাণে বৃষ্টিপাত; stagnant (dj.) - স্থবির; repellent (n.) - বিতাড়ক; measure (n.) - পদক্ষেপ।",

It was a protest against the unfair quota system in government jobs. In June, the High Court announced a 30% quota for the descendants of freedom fighters. Since 26% of jobs were already reserved for other groups, only 44% of positions remained for general applicants. Students found this decision unfair and demanded jobs based on merit. This was the third major protest on this issue, after similar ones in 2013 and 2018. Students skipped classes, blocked roads, and staged demonstrations across the country. The protests continued intensely for days without any solution. In mid-July, the situation turned violent when armed attackers injured hundreds of protesting students. The movement quickly became a fight against the government itself. Students raised their voices against the authoritarian system. On August 3, they announced a one-point demand for the government&#39;s resignation. Finally, on August 5, the student-led movement succeeded. Their unity and determination overthrew the government.

Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So, most of the time he has to cultivate the land of others. Usually, a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some hand-made tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country with more than 80 percent of her population directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. So, our economy is mostly dependent on agriculture. To promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modern cultivation methods.

We achieved this flag through a bloody war against the Pakistani military forces in 1971. The shape of our national flag is rectangular. The ratio of its length and width is 10:6. It is made of cotton, linen or silk. It bears a combination of two colours. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The radius of the circle is one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its deep green colour stands for everlasting youth, freshness and vigour of our nation. It also symbolises the greenery of Bangladesh. On the other hand, the red circle symbolises the rising sun of independence. It also stands for the supreme sacrifices of our heroic freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for the independence of our motherland. The flag is hoisted every day on the top of the buildings of government semi-government offices and educational institutions. Moreover, it is hoisted everywhere on the Independent Day and the Victory Day. Besides, it is kept half-mast on our national mourning days.

The smart phone has also expedited different kinds of cybercrimes. Many people, especially of young age, remain unnecessarily busy with browsing internet. Some people are so obsessed in using internet that they behave in abnormal way. They cannot do much work in time due to wasting time in social media. To get rid of the abuses of smartphone, maintaining a strict schedule of work and increasing real life communication are effective ways. Besides, the parents should keep their children in close observation about their smart phone related activities. The government should adopt cybercrime law strictly to control abuses of smartphone. Thus, we all should control and be aware of the bad effects of smart phone.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E capable (adj.) - সক্ষম; communication (n.) - যোগাযোগ; facilitate (v.) - সহজতর করা; explore (v.) - অন্বেষণ করা; facilitate (v.) - সহজতর করা; realm of knowledge (phr.) - জ্ঞানের ক্ষেত্র; obsessed (adj.) - আবেশিত; effective (adj.) - কার্যকর; schedule (n.) - সময়সূচী; observation (n.) - পর্যবেক্ষণ; control (v.) - নিয়ন্ত্রণ করা; aware of (phr.) - কোনো বিষয়ে সতর্ক।",

Last Sunday, I witnessed a tragic street accident. It took place near our school. There is a turning there. It is an interchange of five roads. Now and then, there occurs a traffic jam. On that day, while I was going to school, I saw a car coming from the western direction. A rickshaw, with a school boy and his mother, was coming from the opposite direction at about 8:30 a.m. While crossing the point, the car hit the rickshaw. The rickshawpuller was able to jump from his seat but the boy and his mother fell on the street. The boy and his mother were seriously wounded. I rushed to them. Some other passers-by also came forward to help them. We led them to a nearby doctor&#39;s chamber. I felt pity for the school boy, he was of my age. In fact, for having no traffic police at that place, such accidents frequently occur. The authority should take steps to stop road accidents that very often claim peoples&#39; lives.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning\u003C/strong\u003E: collision (n.) - সংঘর্ষ; vehicles (n.) - যানবাহন; witnessed (v.) - প্রত্যক্ষ করেছিলাম; direction (n.) -&nbsp; দিক; wounded (adj.) - আহত; rushed (v.) - ছুটে গেলাম; nearby (adj.) - নিকটবর্তী; frequently (adv.) - ঘন ঘন; authority (n.) - কর্তৃপক্ষ।",

Nowadays, traffic jam is a common problem in our towns and cities. It causes great sufferings to the passengers and the passers-by. The increasing number of vehicles mostly causes traffic jam. Day by day, the number of vehicles is increasing to meet the needs of the increased population. But the roads are not increasing in that proportion. Many vehicles moving on the same road at a time cause traffic jam. Many drivers do not abide by traffic rules. Besides, the traffic police are not sincere. The tendency of the bus drivers and conductors to get more passengers also causes traffic jam. Some drivers stop buses here and there and board and unboard passengers. This hampers the movement of other vehicles and causes traffic jam. The unlimited number of rickshaws plying on the streets is another cause of traffic jam. The general people have to face untold sufferings. They reach late at their working places. Students, employees, businessmen, workers all suffer tremendously for this. It occurs mostly during office and school or college time. During traffic jam, we feel extremely bored as it kills our valuable time. To relieve the passengers of the sufferings of traffic jam, some steps should be taken by the government. The drivers who do not abide by traffic rules should be punished. Traffic authority should be active to enforce the traffic rules and maintain the discipline on the roads.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E sufferings (n.) - দুর্ভোগ; proportion (n.) - অনুপাত; abide by (phr.) - মেনে চলা; tendency (n.) &ndash; প্রবণতা; unlimited (adj.) - অসংখ্য; ply (v.) - চলাচল করা; employee (n.) - চাকরিজীবী; tremendously (adv.) -&nbsp; প্রচন্ডভাবে/ব্যাপকভাবে; strict (adj.) - কঠোর, dare (v.) - সাহস করা; vehicle (n.) - যানবাহন; passanger (n.) &ndash; যাত্রী; population (n.) - জনসংখ্যা; sincere (adj.) - আন্তরিক; hamper (v.) - ব্যাহত করা; movement (n.) - চলাচল; face (v.) - মুখোমুখি হওয়া; extremely (adv.) - মারাত্মকভাবে।",

The price of essential commodities is increasing by leaps and bounds. Today, price hike is a common phenomenon in our economy. It has spread its evil clutch all over the country. Prices of daily essentials are increasing alarmingly. People of fixed and limited income are suffering a lot. All are getting worried about this problem. There are many causes behind price hike. The first and foremost cause is over population. Man-made crisis of commodities is another cause. Dishonest businessmen do it for higher profits. Business syndicate, smuggling and corruption are also key causes of price hike. It also depends on international market. Besides, anarchy and unawareness are responsible for it. The effects of price hike are many. Most of the people of Bangladesh are living below poverty line. So, their condition is becoming miserable. Many of them have to remain famished almost every day. The poor children are leaving school in despair. For price hike, the poor are becoming poorer. The problem of price hike is hindering the overall development of our country. We have to take some immediate steps to bring down prices of valuable commodities. At first, we have to control our population. Food production must be increased as much as possible. Also, dishonest businessmen must be punished. To keep price under control, we need political stability as well. The government should store food to cope with any natural disaster. The government should also sell essential commodities for the poor at a lower rate. Smuggling and black marketing are to be eradicated at any cost. Moreover, adequate supply of essential commodities has to be ensured. Above all, conscious people should work together to control price hike.&nbsp;\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E commodity (n.) - দ্রব্যাদি/পণ্যদ্রব্য; leaps and bounds (idi.) - অস্বাভাবিকভাবে বৃদ্ধি; phenomenon (n.) - ব্যাপার; common (adj.) - সাধারণ; economy (n.) - অর্থনীতি; clutch (n.) - থাবা; alarmingly (adv.) - ভীতিজনকভাবে; cause (n.) - কারণ; crisis (n.) - সংকট; profit (n.) - লাভ; smuggling (n.) - চোরাচালান; corruption (n.) - দুর্নীতি; anarchy (n.) - অরাজকতা; unawareness (n.) - অসতর্কতা; responsible (adj.) - দায়ী; condition (n.) - অবস্থা; miserable (adj.) - শোচনীয়; famished (adj.) - ক্ষুধাকাতর; despair (n.) - হতাশা; hinder (v.) - ব্যাহত করা; horrible (adj.) - জনক; eradicate (v.) - মূলোৎপাটন করা; stability (n.) - স্থিতিশীলতা; adequate (adj.) - পর্যন্ত।",

Bangladesh has constructed the bridge with its own resources. It connects Louhajong, Munshiganj to Shariatpur and Madaripur. Thus, it links the south-west of the country to northern and eastern regions. Actually, it has connected 21 southern districts with the capital. The bridge is a two-level steel truss bridge that carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a single-track railway on the lower level. Having 41 spans, and 204 steel piles and 32 vertical bored concrete piles, the bridge is 6.15 km long and 18.18m wide. The rail viaduct has 14 spans of 332 m connecting Mawa end to Jajira end. Apart from transportation, there are other utilities like gas transmission line, optical fiber and telephone line and high voltage electric line through the bridge. The bridge has been constructed by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Company Limited. The project has taken 1062 hectares of land. Starting on 7 December 2014, the construction ended in June 2022. This dream bridge was inaugurated on June 25, 2022 and was opened for vehicles the following day. The Padma Bridge is the most expensive project in the history of Bangladesh. However, the bridge will contribute a lot to the economic development of Bangladesh. It will increase the GDP by as much as 1.2 percent. Thus, the Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a huge milestone in the construction history of Bangladesh.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E multipurpose (adj.) - বহুমুখী; road-rail bridge (phr.) - রাস্তা এবং রেললাইন সংবলিত সেতু; resource (n.) - সম্পদ; steel truss (phr.) - ইস্পাতের কাঠামো; four-lane highway (phr.) - চার লেনবিশিষ্ট মহাসড়ক; single track railway (phr.) - একমুখী রেলওয়ে; vertical (adj.) - উলম্ব; viaduct (n.) - পথ; milestone (n.) - গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ধাপ।",

Human beings, animals, plants, air, water and soil are the main elements of the environment. These elements should be pollution free for our healthy living. But when they are polluted and their balance is disrupted, it is called environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, our environment is getting polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. We, ourselves, are responsible for this situation. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these cause air pollution. Water is polluted from the dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Sound pollution occurs due to the indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, microphones, etc. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. Trees play an important role in conserving the environment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Thus, they save the environment. But trees are being cut down for different commercial purposes. This needs to be stopped for the sake of keeping our environment healthy. Environment pollution is a great threat to our existence. It changes the worlds climate and brings about different kinds of natural disasters. Thus, the world is getting unsuitable for living.

Everything seems hazy and indistinct. Grasses are wet with dew drops. However, when the sun rises, dew drops sparkle like pearls. Old people and children shiver in cold. Poor people gather straw and make fire to bask in the heat. Animals, too, are helpless. They hide themselves in the corner of the house and try to save themselves from the biting cold outside. Elderly people and children usually get up a bit late to evade cold of the early morning. Working people go out when the fog disappears and the sun seems brighter. People sometimes eat homemade cakes with date juice and enjoy the warmth of the early sun while sitting outside their homes. Bangalees settled abroad make it an occasion to return and spend the winter in Bangladesh. They find the winter here pleasant as the winter in any European country is tremendously cold. A winter morning in Bangladesh is thus quite fascinating for them. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor but a boon for the rich.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E foggy (adj.) - কুয়াশাচ্ছন্ন; hazy (adj.) - অস্পষ্ট; indistinct (adj.) - আবছা/ঝাপসা; dew drops (n.phr) - শিশিরকণা; sparkle (v.) - ঝলমল করা; pearl (n.) - মুস্তা; shiver (v.) - কাঁপা; straw (n.) - খড়কুটো; bask (v.) - (আগুন/রোদ) পোহানো; get up (phr.) - ঘুম থেকে জাগা/উঠা; disappear (v.) - অদৃশ্য হওয়া; warmth (n.) - উচ্চতা; spend (v.) - অতিবাহিত করা/কাটানো; pleasant (adj.) - মনোরম; tremendously (adv.) - ভয়ানকভাবে/ভীষণভাবে; fascinating (adj.) - মোহনীয়/মনোমুগ্ধকর; bane (n.) - অভিশাপ/সর্বনাশ; boon (n.) - আশীর্বাদ।",

One is a grown up man who prepares tea and takes bill from the customers and the other is a young boy who serves tea, biscuits etc to the customers.

Sometimes, it drizzles and sometimes, it rains heavily all day long. The sky remains overcast with black clouds. The sun is hardly visible. Gusty wind blows from all sides. Birds keep standing on branches of trees or keep quiet in their nests. Cattle remain in their sheds and bellow for the fodder. Water stands here and there. Unpitched roads become muddy and slippery. Passers-by have to walk with umbrella over their head, shoes in hand and pants folded up to the knee. Sometimes people slip and fall on the muddy road. In cities, a rainy day is now a horror. The roads and streets in some towns and cities get flooded. Vehicles are seen stranding in knee-deep water in some areas due to water clogging. It causes gridlock across the city. It is a day of trouble and annoyance to the office-going people. They have to suffer from various inconveniences. But for the school going children, it is a delight to have a rainy day. If it rains heavily before their school time, they get a holiday. Sometimes, children, especially the boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields. A rainy day is a curse for the poor. The day labourers cannot go out for work and hence, they have to suffer a lot. However, I pass the day by listening to music, watching TV or reading journals.

There are other types of hawkers also. They sell nothing but buy things like empty bottles, old newspapers, magazines, books, plastic and tin containers, broken household items, etc. A street hawker is very cunning. He knows his business very well. His main customers are children and women. So, he usually comes when his customers are free from their usual work and the male persons are not at home. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them at a profit. In fact, their goods are cheaper than those sold in the market. But sometimes, they supply spurious and sub-standard things&nbsp;and cheat the customers. Yet, the service that a street hawker renders to our society is really great. He brings the goods we need daily before our house. When we cannot go out to buy our necessaries, he brings them to our doorstep. However, a street hawker leads a very simple life.

I bought some books on science fiction and comics. After walking for a long time, we became tired. So, we entered a food stall and took some light food. Suddenly, I noticed a crowd in front of a stall. I went there and became surprised to see my favourite writer Abdul Hye Sikder. He was giving autographs. I also took an autograph.

But sometimes it is taken by some people as a habit to get amusement or relief from pain. This habit of taking the harmful drug is called drug addiction. Drug addiction is a curse of modern civilization. Nowadays, it has become a global problem. Drug addiction has grasped the young generation in our country. The people who take the drug cannot stop taking it. There are some reasons behind this addiction. Some take drugs to forget their painful past or present. Some take drugs in pursuit of pleasure. Some people, at first, take a drug as fun but afterwards, it turns into an addiction for them.&nbsp;The aftereffects of drug addiction are very harmful and serious. The health of the addicts breaks down. They lose their mental and physical power. They lose their social status and the love of their nearer and dearer ones as well. Everybody dislikes or hates them. Various kinds of diseases attack them. They suffer from amnesia, insomnia, nausea, physical weakness, blood pressure and from many other critical diseases. Their lungs, kidneys and livers are also damaged. Drugs are very expensive. So, the addicts often go for stealing, hijacking, killing and all sorts of misdeeds to manage money. For this reason, it should be stopped at any cost. Addiction to drugs can be checked by creating social awareness. The mass media can play an effective role in this regard. Seminars, discussions and debates should be held in schools, colleges and universities now and then. The government alone cannot solve this problem. People must cooperate with it. Above all, the rules of religion can play the most important role.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E drug (n.) - মাদক; cure (v.) - উপশম করা; amusement (n.) - বিনোদন; relief (n.) -&nbsp;ব্যথা থেকে মুক্তি; grasp&nbsp;(v.) - গ্রাস করা; painful past (phr.) - বেদনাদায়ক অতীত; pursuit (n.) - পশ্চাদ্ধাবন; break down (phr.) -&nbsp;ভেঙে যাওয়া/ ভেঙে পড়া;&nbsp;social status (phr.) - সামাজিক মর্যাদা; amnesia (n.) - রয়তা; insomnia (n.) - অনিদ্রা; nausea (n.) - বমিভাব; misdeed (n.) - খারাপ কাজ; manage (v.) - যোগানো।",

Most people, who are not even compatible with the Internet, somehow manage to use the social networking services to keep up with the growing trend. A social networking service is basically a platform where people can build social relations based on similar interests, activities and even real life events. Among all other social networks, Facebook is seen to be growing at the fastest rate and hence is the most popular. Before Facebook, another social network &#39;Hi5&#39; dominated the field of the social networking services. Facebook eventually beat Hi5 and took its place with a higher number of users. Apart from Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram are some of the other popular social networks. Social networking sites allow people to have free accounts with which they can connect with people from all parts of the world. There are facilities of privacy settings with which people can enjoy these social networks and also eliminate stalkers and problematic people. The accounts are free for regular people but people who use these social networks for business purposes have to pay a charge to the owners of these networks. Communication has become much easier with social networking services. People can stay connected with their loved ones no matter what the distance is. Photo sharing and video sharing features make it easier for people to know what their close and distant ones are doing. Some of these networks, such as Facebook, allow chatting and video calling which makes communication even better. As long as people know the limit of using social networking services, they pose no harm to the society.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E feature (n.) - বৈশিষ্ট্য; compatible (adj.) - সুসঙ্গত; somehow (adv.) - কোনোভাবে; keep up with (phr.) - তালমিলিয়ে চলা; growing trend (phr.) - জনপ্রিয় ধারা; interest (n.) - পছন্দ; dominate (v.) - কর্তৃত্ব করা; eliminate (v.) - বাদ দেওয়া; stalker (n.) - অনুসরণকারী; stay connected (phr.) - সংযুক্ত থাকা; distant (adj.) - দূরবর্তী; pose (v) - আরোপ&nbsp;করা।",

With the national flag hoisted half-mast, we began our day by placing flowers at the Shaheed Minar in our school. After paying tributes, we attended the rally holding various placards and then marched around the town. Back in school, the authorities had arranged a cultural program where students sang different songs dedicated to the day, some recited poems and teachers gave a brief speech on the significance of 21 February. Around noon, there was an art competition for the students and I participated with my classmates even though I do not know how to draw.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nNo more today.

In your writing, you wanted to know the details about my study tour to the historical place in Sonargaon, Narayanganj.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWell, it was in the last month. The students of classes 9-10 arranged the study tour. Two of our honourable teachers supervised the whole tour. We started to gather at the school gate around 7:00 am in the morning. It was pretty cold but the sight of our tour bus made us excited. The bus started off before 8 am. Soon the breakfast was served. We reached Sonargaon by 9:30 am. It was a jaw-dropping experience when we entered the historical Panam city. We all were impressed by the serene sight. I personally felt as if we had been walking through the history book. The spooky but enchanting ancient doors of the buildings around us boggled our mind. We took many photographs. Some of the members got busy taking selfie using their smart phones. We also took group photographs. One of the most interesting aspects of the tour was a brief class lecture by our teachers while we were inspecting the architecture of the ancient buildings. We learned that those historical buildings were built centuries ago and are related with the history of Baro Bhuiyan. As the capital of the 15 century Bengal ruler Isa Khan, Sonargaon showcases the architecture of the Sultanates, Mughal and colonial periods. It was really an unforgettable experience for me.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nNo more today. My best wishes will always be with you.

On the day, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station very early in the morning. The station was very crowded. We boarded the train and took our seats. I chose a window seat. At 7:30 am, the train blew its whistle and started moving slowly. After a few minutes, it gained speed. Soon, we left the crowded city and entered the countryside. We were passing through the green fields.&nbsp;The farmers were ploughing the fields and taking care of the crops. Shepherds were grazing cattle in the fields. Children were seen playing in the field and making faces at us. Women were washing clothes and taking bath in the ponds. As the train was moving, the trees seemed running backwards. Everything was coming to sight quite fast and then disappearing even faster. The sun was trying to peep through the clouds. Indeed, the scenery was very charming. We passed by many small and big towns. The train finally reached Mymensingh at 10:30 am. Truly, it was a pleasant journey by train. I still cherish the memory of the journey in my mind.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nNo more today.

I believe the main reason for this demotion is the bad company you are keeping. The people you are having around these days are not attentive to studies. Studying hard and gaining knowledge are not their concerns. Also, some of them are heavily addicted to smoking. Some of them do not go to school regularly. If you continue mixing with them, it will affect your studies further. You will also develop bad habits like smoking, bunking off classes, being irregular in the classes, etc. So, I would request you to stay away from evil company. No more today.

Today, I like to share my concern about frequent road accidents. Road accident has become a daily occurrence in our country. The real causes of road accidents lie with the people and not with the mechanised means of transport. Reckless driving and overtaking tendency of the drivers are responsible for most of the accidents. Sometimes, they lose control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rules by both the pedestrians and the drivers also causes road accidents. In some cities, roads are too narrow and inadequate. These can hardly cope with the ever-increasing volume of traffic. Every year, thousands of people die and many more get injured in road accidents. Sometimes, the injured have to embrace disability forever. Road accidents have become a great menace in our society. Stern steps must be taken to check this danger. Spacious roads should be constructed and traffic signals should be set up at the key points. Heavy penalty should be imposed on those who violate the traffic rules. Moreover, common people should be made aware of the traffic rules through radio, television, newspapers and posters.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nOk, I will be longing for your further text.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nYour friend,\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSabuj",

Poor fire safety rules, unplanned urbanization, and unsafe gas and electrical systems have contributed to many of these incidents. A fire safety workshop can guide staff and students on fire alarms, evacuation routes, using fire extinguishers and identifying fire hazards.
