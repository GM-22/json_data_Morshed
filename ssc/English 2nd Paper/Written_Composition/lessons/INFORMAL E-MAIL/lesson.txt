I believe the main reason for this demotion is the bad company you are keeping. The people you are having around these days are not attentive to studies. Studying hard and gaining knowledge are not their concerns. Also, some of them are heavily addicted to smoking. Some of them do not go to school regularly. If you continue mixing with them, it will affect your studies further. You will also develop bad habits like smoking, bunking off classes, being irregular in the classes, etc. So, I would request you to stay away from evil company. No more today.

Today, I like to share my concern about frequent road accidents. Road accident has become a daily occurrence in our country. The real causes of road accidents lie with the people and not with the mechanised means of transport. Reckless driving and overtaking tendency of the drivers are responsible for most of the accidents. Sometimes, they lose control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rules by both the pedestrians and the drivers also causes road accidents. In some cities, roads are too narrow and inadequate. These can hardly cope with the ever-increasing volume of traffic. Every year, thousands of people die and many more get injured in road accidents. Sometimes, the injured have to embrace disability forever. Road accidents have become a great menace in our society. Stern steps must be taken to check this danger. Spacious roads should be constructed and traffic signals should be set up at the key points. Heavy penalty should be imposed on those who violate the traffic rules. Moreover, common people should be made aware of the traffic rules through radio, television, newspapers and posters.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nOk, I will be longing for your further text.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nYour friend,\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSabuj",
