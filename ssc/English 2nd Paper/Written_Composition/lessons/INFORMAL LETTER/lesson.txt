Every year, our teachers organize a day full of activities to commemorate the martyrs and celebrate our language, culture and history. This year was not different. With the national flag hoisted half-mast, we began our day by placing flowers at the Shaheed Minar in our school. After paying tributes, we attended the rally holding various placards and then marched around the town. Back in school, the authorities had arranged a cultural program where students sang different songs dedicated to the day, some recited poems and teachers gave a brief speech on the significance of 21 February. Around noon, there was an art competition for the students and I participated with my classmates even though I do not know how to draw.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nNo more today.

The students of classes 9-10 arranged the study tour. Two of our honourable teachers supervised the whole tour. We started to gather at the school gate around 7:00 am in the morning. It was pretty cold but the sight of our tour bus made us excited. The bus started off before 8 am. Soon the breakfast was served. We reached Sonargaon by 9:30 am. It was a jaw-dropping experience when we entered the historical Panam city. We all were impressed by the serene sight. I personally felt as if we had been walking through the history book. The spooky but enchanting ancient doors of the buildings around us boggled our mind. We took many photographs. Some of the members got busy taking selfie using their smart phones. We also took group photographs. One of the most interesting aspects of the tour was a brief class lecture by our teachers while we were inspecting the architecture of the ancient buildings. We learned that those historical buildings were built centuries ago and are related with the history of Baro Bhuiyan. As the capital of the 15 century Bengal ruler Isa Khan, Sonargaon showcases the architecture of the Sultanates, Mughal and colonial periods.

On the day, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station very early in the morning. The station was very crowded. We boarded the train and took our seats. I chose a window seat. At 7:30 am, the train blew its whistle and started moving slowly. After a few minutes, it gained speed. Soon, we left the crowded city and entered the countryside. We were passing through the green fields.&nbsp;The farmers were ploughing the fields and taking care of the crops. Shepherds were grazing cattle in the fields. Children were seen playing in the field and making faces at us. Women were washing clothes and taking bath in the ponds. As the train was moving, the trees seemed running backwards. Everything was coming to sight quite fast and then disappearing even faster. The sun was trying to peep through the clouds. Indeed, the scenery was very charming. We passed by many small and big towns. The train finally reached Mymensingh at 10:30 am. Truly, it was a pleasant journey by train.

It is a South-Asian country surrounded by India on three sides and the Bay of Bengal on the south. Myanmar lies to her south-east.

The country achieved independence in 1971 after fighting against the well-equipped Pakistani Army for nine months. We are the only nation who has the glory of fighting for its mother language. Our Language Movement took place in 1952. We have a long cultural tradition, literature, arts, etc. that are very developed and have acquired international recognition. The people in Bangladesh are very hard-working, ready to face any obstacles. They are veryhospitable. They become very happy when they have a guest at home and try their best to entertain the guest. They like to talk a lot, even to the strangers or foreigners. People here are much curious about foreigners. They would even ask an unknown person about personal details.

The clubs are places where one can go and pursue his or her hobby. I am a member of the debating club. We practice debating within the club and arrange debating competitions among classes and with other schools as well. Our English teacher, who runs this club, not only guides us in writing good speeches but also shows us how to present them. Our school arranges essay competitions and book reading competitions. Moreover, my school offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the students. The school has a musical group and a lot of plays are staged by the students. Besides, the students enjoy hockey and football as extra-curricular activities. Teachers consult with the students at&nbsp;personal level and encourage them to work more and more.
