Bangladesh has constructed the bridge with its own resources. It connects Louhajong, Munshiganj to Shariatpur and Madaripur. Thus, it links the south-west of the country to northern and eastern regions. Actually, it has connected 21 southern districts with the capital. The bridge is a two-level steel truss bridge that carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a single-track railway on the lower level. Having 41 spans, and 204 steel piles and 32 vertical bored concrete piles, the bridge is 6.15 km long and 18.18m wide. The rail viaduct has 14 spans of 332 m connecting Mawa end to Jajira end. Apart from transportation, there are other utilities like gas transmission line, optical fiber and telephone line and high voltage electric line through the bridge. The bridge has been constructed by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Company Limited. The project has taken 1062 hectares of land. Starting on 7 December 2014, the construction ended in June 2022. This dream bridge was inaugurated on June 25, 2022 and was opened for vehicles the following day. The Padma Bridge is the most expensive project in the history of Bangladesh. However, the bridge will contribute a lot to the economic development of Bangladesh. It will increase the GDP by as much as 1.2 percent. Thus, the Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a huge milestone in the construction history of Bangladesh.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E multipurpose (adj.) - বহুমুখী; road-rail bridge (phr.) - রাস্তা এবং রেললাইন সংবলিত সেতু; resource (n.) - সম্পদ; steel truss (phr.) - ইস্পাতের কাঠামো; four-lane highway (phr.) - চার লেনবিশিষ্ট মহাসড়ক; single track railway (phr.) - একমুখী রেলওয়ে; vertical (adj.) - উলম্ব; viaduct (n.) - পথ; milestone (n.) - গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ধাপ।",

Most people, who are not even compatible with the Internet, somehow manage to use the social networking services to keep up with the growing trend. A social networking service is basically a platform where people can build social relations based on similar interests, activities and even real life events. Among all other social networks, Facebook is seen to be growing at the fastest rate and hence is the most popular. Before Facebook, another social network &#39;Hi5&#39; dominated the field of the social networking services. Facebook eventually beat Hi5 and took its place with a higher number of users. Apart from Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram are some of the other popular social networks. Social networking sites allow people to have free accounts with which they can connect with people from all parts of the world. There are facilities of privacy settings with which people can enjoy these social networks and also eliminate stalkers and problematic people. The accounts are free for regular people but people who use these social networks for business purposes have to pay a charge to the owners of these networks. Communication has become much easier with social networking services. People can stay connected with their loved ones no matter what the distance is. Photo sharing and video sharing features make it easier for people to know what their close and distant ones are doing. Some of these networks, such as Facebook, allow chatting and video calling which makes communication even better. As long as people know the limit of using social networking services, they pose no harm to the society.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E feature (n.) - বৈশিষ্ট্য; compatible (adj.) - সুসঙ্গত; somehow (adv.) - কোনোভাবে; keep up with (phr.) - তালমিলিয়ে চলা; growing trend (phr.) - জনপ্রিয় ধারা; interest (n.) - পছন্দ; dominate (v.) - কর্তৃত্ব করা; eliminate (v.) - বাদ দেওয়া; stalker (n.) - অনুসরণকারী; stay connected (phr.) - সংযুক্ত থাকা; distant (adj.) - দূরবর্তী; pose (v) - আরোপ&nbsp;করা।",

But sometimes it is taken by some people as a habit to get amusement or relief from pain. This habit of taking the harmful drug is called drug addiction. Drug addiction is a curse of modern civilization. Nowadays, it has become a global problem. Drug addiction has grasped the young generation in our country. The people who take the drug cannot stop taking it. There are some reasons behind this addiction. Some take drugs to forget their painful past or present. Some take drugs in pursuit of pleasure. Some people, at first, take a drug as fun but afterwards, it turns into an addiction for them.&nbsp;The aftereffects of drug addiction are very harmful and serious. The health of the addicts breaks down. They lose their mental and physical power. They lose their social status and the love of their nearer and dearer ones as well. Everybody dislikes or hates them. Various kinds of diseases attack them. They suffer from amnesia, insomnia, nausea, physical weakness, blood pressure and from many other critical diseases. Their lungs, kidneys and livers are also damaged. Drugs are very expensive. So, the addicts often go for stealing, hijacking, killing and all sorts of misdeeds to manage money. For this reason, it should be stopped at any cost. Addiction to drugs can be checked by creating social awareness. The mass media can play an effective role in this regard. Seminars, discussions and debates should be held in schools, colleges and universities now and then. The government alone cannot solve this problem. People must cooperate with it. Above all, the rules of religion can play the most important role.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E drug (n.) - মাদক; cure (v.) - উপশম করা; amusement (n.) - বিনোদন; relief (n.) -&nbsp;ব্যথা থেকে মুক্তি; grasp&nbsp;(v.) - গ্রাস করা; painful past (phr.) - বেদনাদায়ক অতীত; pursuit (n.) - পশ্চাদ্ধাবন; break down (phr.) -&nbsp;ভেঙে যাওয়া/ ভেঙে পড়া;&nbsp;social status (phr.) - সামাজিক মর্যাদা; amnesia (n.) - রয়তা; insomnia (n.) - অনিদ্রা; nausea (n.) - বমিভাব; misdeed (n.) - খারাপ কাজ; manage (v.) - যোগানো।",

I saw that all kinds of books such as fiction, drama, poetry, novel, biography, translation, childrens literature, story books, etc. were available at the fair. I bought some books on science fiction and comics. After walking for a long time, we became tired. So, we entered a food stall and took some light food. Suddenly, I noticed a crowd in front of a stall. I went there and became surprised to see my favourite writer Abdul Hye Sikder. He was giving autographs. I also took an autograph.

He is a common figure on our street. Generally, he sells various items like toys, clothes, fruits, utensils, vegetables, ice-cream, and so on. He carries his goods on his head or shoulder and sometimes in a small handcart. He walks along roads and streets from dawn to dusk. He shouts the names of the items he sells. There are other types of hawkers also. They sell nothing but buy things like empty bottles, old newspapers, magazines, books, plastic and tin containers, broken household items, etc. A street hawker is very cunning. He knows his business very well. His main customers are children and women. So, he usually comes when his customers are free from their usual work and the male persons are not at home. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them at a profit. In fact, their goods are cheaper than those sold in the market. But sometimes, they supply spurious and sub-standard things&nbsp;and cheat the customers. Yet, the service that a street hawker renders to our society is really great.

Sometimes, it drizzles and sometimes, it rains heavily all day long. The sky remains overcast with black clouds. The sun is hardly visible. Gusty wind blows from all sides. Birds keep standing on branches of trees or keep quiet in their nests. Cattle remain in their sheds and bellow for the fodder. Water stands here and there. Unpitched roads become muddy and slippery. Passers-by have to walk with umbrella over their head, shoes in hand and pants folded up to the knee. Sometimes people slip and fall on the muddy road. In cities, a rainy day is now a horror. The roads and streets in some towns and cities get flooded. Vehicles are seen stranding in knee-deep water in some areas due to water clogging. It causes gridlock across the city. It is a day of trouble and annoyance to the office-going people. They have to suffer from various inconveniences. But for the school going children, it is a delight to have a rainy day. If it rains heavily before their school time, they get a holiday. Sometimes, children, especially the boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields. A rainy day is a curse for the poor. The day labourers cannot go out for work and hence, they have to suffer a lot. However, I pass the day by listening to music, watching TV or reading journals.

It is usually decorated with chairs, tables and benches. People go to a tea stall to take a cup of tea to remove their tiredness. A tea stall is kept open from early morning till late night. In a tea stall there are generally two people to manage and run it. One is a grown up man who prepares tea and takes bill from the customers and the other is a young boy who serves tea, biscuits etc to the customers.

Everything seems hazy and indistinct. Grasses are wet with dew drops. However, when the sun rises, dew drops sparkle like pearls. Old people and children shiver in cold. Poor people gather straw and make fire to bask in the heat. Animals, too, are helpless. They hide themselves in the corner of the house and try to save themselves from the biting cold outside. Elderly people and children usually get up a bit late to evade cold of the early morning. Working people go out when the fog disappears and the sun seems brighter. People sometimes eat homemade cakes with date juice and enjoy the warmth of the early sun while sitting outside their homes. Bangalees settled abroad make it an occasion to return and spend the winter in Bangladesh. They find the winter here pleasant as the winter in any European country is tremendously cold. A winter morning in Bangladesh is thus quite fascinating for them.

Human beings, animals, plants, air, water and soil are the main elements of the environment. These elements should be pollution free for our healthy living. But when they are polluted and their balance is disrupted, it is called environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, our environment is getting polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. We, ourselves, are responsible for this situation. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these cause air pollution. Water is polluted from the dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Sound pollution occurs due to the indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, microphones, etc. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. Trees play an important role in conserving the environment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Thus, they save the environment. But trees are being cut down for different commercial purposes. This needs to be stopped for the sake of keeping our environment healthy. Environment pollution is a great threat to our existence. It changes the worlds climate and brings about different kinds of natural disasters. Thus, the world is getting unsuitable for living.

It often delivers powerful messages, expressing opinions or protesting against injustices. Graffiti allows people to express their thoughts and emotions creatively. During the July Revolution of 2024 in our country, graffiti became a vital tool for protest. After the assassination of a student activist named Abu Sayeed in Rangpur, students painted a mural with the words, &quot;Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?&quot; Although the mural was removed the next morning, it left a lasting impression. After the fall of the dictatorial government on 5 August 2024, graffiti spread across Bangladesh. Students painted walls to honor martyrs and support the revolution. Slogans appeared on walls in Dhaka and other parts of the country, alongside symbols like clenched fists and the rising sun. Graffiti became a way to exercise freedom of speech and draw attention to ignored issues. Students, artists, and even rickshaw pullers joined the movement, with donations supporting their efforts. Graffiti has since become a voice for the people, symbolizing hope and unity.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E art (n.) - শিল্প; express (v.) - ব্যস্ত করা; injustice (n.) - অবিচার; thoughts (n.) - চিন্তা-চেতনা; vital (adj.) - অপরিহার্য; protest (n.) - প্রতিবাদ; assassination (n.) - হত্যা; mural (n.) - দেয়ালচিত্র; impression (n.) - ছাপ; doctorial (adj.) - স্বৈরাচার; revolution (n.) - বিপ্লব; clenched (adj.) - মুষ্টিবন্ধ; fist (n.) - মুষ্টি; freedom of speech (phr.) - বাকস্বাধীনতা।",

The price of essential commodities is increasing by leaps and bounds. Today, price hike is a common phenomenon in our economy. It has spread its evil clutch all over the country. Prices of daily essentials are increasing alarmingly. People of fixed and limited income are suffering a lot. All are getting worried about this problem. There are many causes behind price hike. The first and foremost cause is over population. Man-made crisis of commodities is another cause. Dishonest businessmen do it for higher profits. Business syndicate, smuggling and corruption are also key causes of price hike. It also depends on international market. Besides, anarchy and unawareness are responsible for it. The effects of price hike are many. Most of the people of Bangladesh are living below poverty line. So, their condition is becoming miserable. Many of them have to remain famished almost every day. The poor children are leaving school in despair. For price hike, the poor are becoming poorer. The problem of price hike is hindering the overall development of our country. We have to take some immediate steps to bring down prices of valuable commodities. At first, we have to control our population. Food production must be increased as much as possible. Also, dishonest businessmen must be punished. To keep price under control, we need political stability as well. The government should store food to cope with any natural disaster. The government should also sell essential commodities for the poor at a lower rate. Smuggling and black marketing are to be eradicated at any cost. Moreover, adequate supply of essential commodities has to be ensured.

Nowadays, traffic jam is a common problem in our towns and cities. It causes great sufferings to the passengers and the passers-by. The increasing number of vehicles mostly causes traffic jam. Day by day, the number of vehicles is increasing to meet the needs of the increased population. But the roads are not increasing in that proportion. Many vehicles moving on the same road at a time cause traffic jam. Many drivers do not abide by traffic rules. Besides, the traffic police are not sincere. The tendency of the bus drivers and conductors to get more passengers also causes traffic jam. Some drivers stop buses here and there and board and unboard passengers. This hampers the movement of other vehicles and causes traffic jam. The unlimited number of rickshaws plying on the streets is another cause of traffic jam. The general people have to face untold sufferings. They reach late at their working places. Students, employees, businessmen, workers all suffer tremendously for this. It occurs mostly during office and school or college time. During traffic jam, we feel extremely bored as it kills our valuable time. To relieve the passengers of the sufferings of traffic jam, some steps should be taken by the government. The drivers who do not abide by traffic rules should be punished. Traffic authority should be active to enforce the traffic rules and maintain the discipline on the roads.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E sufferings (n.) - দুর্ভোগ; proportion (n.) - অনুপাত; abide by (phr.) - মেনে চলা; tendency (n.) &ndash; প্রবণতা; unlimited (adj.) - অসংখ্য; ply (v.) - চলাচল করা; employee (n.) - চাকরিজীবী; tremendously (adv.) -&nbsp; প্রচন্ডভাবে/ব্যাপকভাবে; strict (adj.) - কঠোর, dare (v.) - সাহস করা; vehicle (n.) - যানবাহন; passanger (n.) &ndash; যাত্রী; population (n.) - জনসংখ্যা; sincere (adj.) - আন্তরিক; hamper (v.) - ব্যাহত করা; movement (n.) - চলাচল; face (v.) - মুখোমুখি হওয়া; extremely (adv.) - মারাত্মকভাবে।",

Last Sunday, I witnessed a tragic street accident. It took place near our school. There is a turning there. It is an interchange of five roads. Now and then, there occurs a traffic jam. On that day, while I was going to school, I saw a car coming from the western direction. A rickshaw, with a school boy and his mother, was coming from the opposite direction at about 8:30 a.m. While crossing the point, the car hit the rickshaw. The rickshawpuller was able to jump from his seat but the boy and his mother fell on the street. The boy and his mother were seriously wounded. I rushed to them. Some other passers-by also came forward to help them. We led them to a nearby doctor&#39;s chamber. I felt pity for the school boy, he was of my age. In fact, for having no traffic police at that place, such accidents frequently occur.

The most common uses of smart phone are internet searching and web browsing. Other uses of smartphone are making phone call, listening to music, using social media apps, capturing and sharing photos and videos etc. The effects of Smart phone on human life is huge. At present, there is hardly any person who doesnt have a smartphone. Smart phone has enabled us to communicate with the people of the whole world in an instant. It has facilitated our life to a great extent. But alongside the huge number of benefits that we get from smart phone, it also brings about some troubles in our life. Access to huge number of data across the world through internet is a great threat to our creativity. It has also minimized our thirst for exploring the realm of knowledge that we are supposed to gain by participating physically in different expeditions. The smart phone has also expedited different kinds of cybercrimes. Many people, especially of young age, remain unnecessarily busy with browsing internet. Some people are so obsessed in using internet that they behave in abnormal way. They cannot do much work in time due to wasting time in social media. To get rid of the abuses of smartphone, maintaining a strict schedule of work and increasing real life communication are effective ways. Besides, the parents should keep their children in close observation about their smart phone related activities. The government should adopt cybercrime law strictly to control abuses of smartphone. Thus, we all should control and be aware of the bad effects of smart phone.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E capable (adj.) - সক্ষম; communication (n.) - যোগাযোগ; facilitate (v.) - সহজতর করা; explore (v.) - অন্বেষণ করা; facilitate (v.) - সহজতর করা; realm of knowledge (phr.) - জ্ঞানের ক্ষেত্র; obsessed (adj.) - আবেশিত; effective (adj.) - কার্যকর; schedule (n.) - সময়সূচী; observation (n.) - পর্যবেক্ষণ; control (v.) - নিয়ন্ত্রণ করা; aware of (phr.) - কোনো বিষয়ে সতর্ক।",

Every free nation of the world has its own national flag. It introduces a country to the whole world. As a free nation, we also have a national flag of our own. We achieved this flag through a bloody war against the Pakistani military forces in 1971. The shape of our national flag is rectangular. The ratio of its length and width is 10:6. It is made of cotton, linen or silk. It bears a combination of two colours. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The radius of the circle is one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its deep green colour stands for everlasting youth, freshness and vigour of our nation. It also symbolises the greenery of Bangladesh. On the other hand, the red circle symbolises the rising sun of independence. It also stands for the supreme sacrifices of our heroic freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for the independence of our motherland. The flag is hoisted every day on the top of the buildings of government semi-government offices and educational institutions. Moreover, it is hoisted everywhere on the Independent Day and the Victory Day. Besides, it is kept half-mast on our national mourning days. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hope, and aspiration.

Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So, most of the time he has to cultivate the land of others. Usually, a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some hand-made tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country with more than 80 percent of her population directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. So, our economy is mostly dependent on agriculture. To promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modern cultivation methods. This is how, the life of a farmer can be developed.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning:\u003C/strong\u003E cultivate (v.) - চাষ করা; grow (v.) -&nbsp;জন্মানো; pitiable (adj.) - শোচনীয়; illiterate (adj.) - অশিক্ষিত;&nbsp;plough (v.) - লাঙল দিয়ে চাষ করা; scientifically (adv.) -&nbsp;বৈজ্ঞানিকভাবে; pesticide (n.) - কীটনাশক; harvest (n.) - ফসল;&nbsp;sorrows know no bound (phr.) - দুঃখের কোনো সীমা নেই এমন&nbsp;engaged (v.) - নিয়োজিত; bumper crop (phr.) - প্রচুর পরিমাণ&nbsp;শস্য; subsidies (n.) - ভর্তুকি; age-old (adj.) - অনেক পুরোনো।",

It was a protest against the unfair quota system in government jobs. In June, the High Court announced a 30% quota for the descendants of freedom fighters. Since 26% of jobs were already reserved for other groups, only 44% of positions remained for general applicants. Students found this decision unfair and demanded jobs based on merit. This was the third major protest on this issue, after similar ones in 2013 and 2018. Students skipped classes, blocked roads, and staged demonstrations across the country. The protests continued intensely for days without any solution. In mid-July, the situation turned violent when armed attackers injured hundreds of protesting students. The movement quickly became a fight against the government itself. Students raised their voices against the authoritarian system. On August 3, they announced a one-point demand for the government&#39;s resignation. Finally, on August 5, the student-led movement succeeded. Their unity and determination overthrew the government. This movement became a symbol of the students&#39; fight for fairness and justice in Bangladesh.\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWord Meaning: \u003C/strong\u003Ediscrimination (n.) - বৈষম্য; protest (n.) - প্রতিবাদ; descendant (n.) - বংশধর; unfair (adj.) - অন্যায্য; demand (v.) - দাবী করা; merit (n.) - মেধা; demonstrations (n.) - বিক্ষোভ; intensely (adv.) - তীব্রভাবে; violent (adj.) - সহিংস; protesting students (phr.) - আন্দোলনরত শিক্ষার্থী; authoritarian system (phr.) - কর্তৃত্ববাদী ব্যবস্থা; determination (n.) - দৃঢ়প্রতিজ্ঞতা; overthrew (v.) - পতন ঘটানো।",

Aedes mosquitos are responsible for the transmission of this virus. The virus easily spreads from people to mosquitos and from mosquitos to people. Once a person is affected by this virus, a mosquito bearing no germs of dengue can be loaded up with the virus while biting the infected person. After that, if the mosquito bites a healthy person, it transmits the virus to him. The infected person usually shows the symptoms within 4 to 12 days of being infected. The symptoms include high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint pain, rash, etc. Once someone is infected by the virus and starts to show the symptoms of dengue fever, immediate actions should be taken.
