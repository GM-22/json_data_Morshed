They are the devotees in the temple of learning. So, the most important duty of students is to study seriously with devotion. It does not mean that they are isolated from the society. They are also social beings like other classes of people. They enjoy the same social benefits, rights and privileges. So, as members of society, they have certain duties to the society in which they live in. There are many kinds of social services and students have a lot to do in these sectors.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nLiving in a developing country like ours, students must render some social services for the development and welfare of the nation. So during the long vacation and leisure time, students can open night schools and teach the illiterate working children and adult people. They can also teach the farmers about the modern methods of cultivation, the use of fertilizers and proper caring of crops. They can also suggest them to dig a pond for fish cultivation or to make a farm.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nStudents can render immense service in the field of health. The village people and the people living in the slums have no knowledge about health, nutrition and sanitation. The students can teach them about the basic rules of health, nutrition and sanitation. Female students can also teach the uneducated women how to keep their houses neat and clean, how to bring up children and look after their health.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nStudents can prove themselves to be worthy citizens during natural disasters. In times of flood, famine and cyclone, earthquake and epidemic, they can come forward to help the affected people. They can collect money from the rich, rescue the affected, feed the hungry, nurse the sick and clothe the unclothed. During epidemics, medical students can serve the sick with food, clothes and medicine.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nStudents are a great source of strength to the country. They have ideals, energy and power to work. If they are rightly guided, they can really render very valuable service to society. There must be selfless leaders to make right use of them. Under proper guidance and noble inspiration they can do wonders.",

It is the computer-based global information system. By accessing to internet today, the vast treasure of all forms of knowledge, information, inventions, techniques, process, technologies, arts, literature etc. can be made available. It has made inroads into all walks of our life.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe internet is composed of many interconnected computer networks. Each network may link tens, hundreds and even thousands of computers, enabling them to share information with one another and to share computational resources such as powerful super computers and databases of information.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nToday through internet, people all over the world can communicate effectively and inexpensively with one another. Unlike traditional broadcasting media, such as radio and television, the internet does not have centralised distribution system.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn this world of globalisation and IT revolution, internet is the key player to make it happen so. The internet has brought about new opportunities to government, business and education. Government uses the internet for internal communication, distribution of information and automated tax processing. In Bangladesh, the use of internet has taken a leap in the last few years. The government of our country can take it as an aid to decision making process for each agency and ministry of the government. This can help bringing transparency in the very process of governance. In addition to offering goods and services on line to customers, business men use internet to connect with other business men. Today many individuals use the internet for shopping, paying bills and online banking. Educational institutions use the internet for research and to deliver courses to students on line at remote sites.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nNot to say, it has some abuses too. Nowadays especially the teen agers are very prone to absorb the demerits of internet. They sometimes keep chatting and whiling away their time with their friends or even unknown persons when they are supposed to be at their desk to study. They tend to enjoy pornography and do many immoral and hazardous tasks diving into dark webs. Thus, they are going away from their study and becoming morally degraded. In addition, sometimes criminal and terrorists take the advantage of internet to actualize their target. They exploit Cyber Cafe as their means of fulfilling their task. To belittle and derogate others, some heinous and immoral persons mail many messages and vulgar pictures to different addresses.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn fine, we should use internet sorting the best out of it so that we ourselves can be benefited and can benefit others too. To keep pace with the rest of the world in every sector, we must be connected with internet.",

Science is inventing wonder after wonder and magic after magic like ALADINS magic lamp. It has made impossible possible. We feel the impact of science almost in every walk of our life. For example, computer has brought a great change in our life. Now we can do calculations with great speed and accuracy. It can process, manipulate, reproduce and communicate data at a very high speed. We cannot imagine life without computer.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn addition, computer is an electronic device used for storing and analyzing information fed into it, for calculating, or for controlling machinery automatically. They do automatic fine tuning and colour regulating on television sets and other household gadgets. In offices, computer is used to maintain records, files, prepare payrolls apart from performing various other functions. In hospital, computer is used to diagnose diseases. It helps in carrying out surgeries.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nMoreover, computer is rendering valuable service to the radars, missiles, rocket launching, automatic flights, etc. We have pilotless aeroplanes which are controlled by computers from the ground stations. Airlines and railways are now offering instant information on bookings with the help of computers. Computers help big business houses in carrying out their up-to-date business. Computers are widely used to solve climatic, industrial, commercial, financial and other complicated problems. In advanced countries, computers are used to regulate and control traffic.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nHowever, computer is not blessing in all. It has caused to create many problems. A computer can perform works of several people. It has increased the rate of unemployment. It has replaced scores of people. Often the mistakes made by computers are really blunders. Excessive dependence of man on computers have reduced mental efficiency in human beings. Internet is often used for mischievous intentions. They are used to send false e-mails for malicious intentions to harass the person. Some others try to view those websites that are not meant for them. This is a bad tendency and must be checked. Internet should be for development and other good purposes and not for destruction and decay.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nComputers have many shortcomings. However, their advantages far outweigh their disadvantages. They are integral part of modern life. We cannot think of life without computers.",

Childhood is an important part of human life as many events of both pleasure and pain take place during that period.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nTo me childhood is the sweetest period in a man&#39;s life. The memories of my childhood haunt me like a passion very often. Whenever I feel very lonely or dejected, I dive into the memories of my childhood, remove my loneliness and fill my heart with happiness. Then, I wish I could be a child again!\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe memories of my school days dominate my childhood. I was sent to school at six. I studied in a distant primary school named Kanchichora Government Primary school upto class two. Then I was made to take my admission in another school called Mathbari Government Primary School. I used to go to school with my village friends. My cousin who was one year senior to me was my constant school-going companion. In school the classes were not much interesting to me but the leisure period while we used to play various sports. I was a regular student in my class. So I was hardly beaten or scolded by my teachers for negligence to studies. After the school was over, in our way home, we used to play ha-du-du, hide and seek, gather plums or steal green mangoes from some trees and sometimes used to hath in stream. One day I along with my three friends went to a friend&#39;s house to eat green-plum. But as the tree was long, none of us dared to climb it up. Hence, we had to come back in a dissatisfied mind.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn my school I was not a good athlete. Yet I used to take part in various events. Once I got two prizes in race and long-jump and therefore became very excited and happy. The holidays were favourite to me. On holidays I used to play with my friends almost the whole day.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSometimes I would go to some other village for play. I also would visit my nearby relatives on holidays. How happy I was in my childhood days! The happy and pleasant memories of those days still give me pleasure. If I could go back to those days again!",

An aimless life is like a boat without a rudder that can never reach its goal. To succeed in life one should have a future plan from one&#39;s early life. This is called an aim in life. Therefore, it can be said that one&#39;s aim is one&#39;s future plan for life.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nNow I am a student. I believe that this period is a unique opportunity to do something and to succeed in life. I have decided to be a teacher. I know it is a very hard task. But I want to develop my nation. A teacher can lead the nation to the highest stage of prosperity if he can properly teach the students with his ideals.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nI want to serve the nation through proper teaching. A good teacher lives in the mind of the people of a nation forever. Our nation is a poor one. Illiteracy is a vital cause of our poverty. It is the root of all of our obstacles. If our students are properly educated, they can alleviate our poverty. By being a teacher, I am determined to serve the nation.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn order to fulfil my future plan, I must acquire some degrees. I sympathise all students who fail in English. So, I want to be a teacher of English. After passing my HSC Examination, I will get myself admitted into Honour&#39;s in English. After completing my Honour&#39;s and Master&#39;s degrees, I shall join a college to teach the students with my best effort. I would like to choose a rural area as my working place.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nI would like to serve my country sincerely. The condition of English in our country is very poor. I would like to improve it. If our nation is capable enough to communicate internationally, she can easily reach her destination to prosperity. Though English is a foreign language, we hardly can do anything without it in this age. I shall teach my students the four skills of language listening, speaking, reading and writing within the shortest possible time.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nI pray to Allah for the success of my future plan. I have been studying heart and soul to build up a strong background of English in me. Apart from the school texts, I regularly go through English newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals, etc. to improve my stock of vocabulary. I hope I shall be able to translate my aim or future plan into reality by the grace of Almighty creator.",

Like many people of this region, I love to enjoy this game very much. In fact, it has been my most favourite game and I don&#39;t miss any chance to enjoy it.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe most important reason for which I like this game is that a single match is full of occasions when the spectators get enthralled and excited. On the part of the batsmen, there are sixes and fours, Every boundary and over boundary gives the spectators so much excitement. Then, there are singles, twos, threes, etc. which also entertain the spectators greatly. On the part of the bowlers, there are inswings, outswings, yorkers, etc, and these things give much pleasure to the spectators. However, the most exciting event for the bowlers is the fall of wickets. Besides, the fielders also eentertain the spectators with extraordinary catches, breathtaking run-outs, and acrobatic body movement on the ground and even in the air.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSecondly, this game is termed as a game of uncertainty. This is a unique characteristic of any cricket match. Most often, none can say which team will win the match. When the match ends in the last over or in the last ball of the innings, the pleasures and excitement of winning team&#39;s players and the spectators know no bounds. Thirdly, it is also called the gentlemens game. The players are usually gentle, polite and very considerate in their behaviour. While in the other games, there are many incidents of physical conflicts between or among the players, in cricket, they usually stay far away from one another. Furthermore, the umpires in the field also stand in the field and can easily watch over any unwanted incidents among the players. As a result, players hardly involve in any conflict, let alone physical clashes.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nFinally, this game requires the players to work hard in a disciplined manner. They have to take regular physical exercise to maintain their fitness. So, they usually enjoy a sound health.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn conclusion, I take pride in being a fan of such a fantastic game like cricket. I not only enjoy watching cricket matches, but also love to play it with the local boys.",

It also increases our reading skills and indirectly writing skills as well.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSometimes, many fabricated or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in society. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of the people. Otherwise, it might hamper national and international relations. In developing international relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various job advertisements. So, they are helpful in removing unemployment. The stories and novels published in newspapers give us much pleasure.

The then Prime Minister, had to resign and flee the country because of a mass uprising.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe events leading to &#39;36 July&#39; began earlier in June 2024. On 5 June, the High Court Division restored the quota system in government jobs. This decision upset the general students, who wanted reforms in the system. As a result, they began their protest. By 16 July, the situation turned violent as the government tried to suppress the movement. Law enforcement agencies were deployed to suppress the students. They fired bullets at students and innocent people, charged with batons and detained the protesters, but could not stop them from protesting. On 21 July, the Supreme Court supported the demand for quota reform. However, the protesters had more demands. They sought justice for the killings during the protests, which they referred to as the &#39;July Massacre&#39;. To put emphasis on the continuation of the protest, the students started counting the days of July beyond its usual 31 days. For them, 1 August became &#39;32 July&#39;, and this counting continued.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe protest grew stronger. On 4 August, the protesters announced a non-cooperation movement, naming the day &#39;35 July&#39;. The next day, 5 August, was marked as &#39;36 July&#39;. On this day, thousands of people marched to Dhaka from different parts of Bangladesh. The mass uprising forced the then Prime Minister to resign and flee the country. The protesters called their success the &#39;Second Independence&#39; or &#39;Rebirth Day&#39;.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe term 36 July is now a symbol of unity and courage. It appears in murals, graffiti and art across the country. It reminds us of the peoples power and shows that unity and bravery can bring about meaningful change.",

It shares messages, opinions, or protests in creative ways. During the July Revolution in 2024, graffiti became a powerful tool for students to express their feelings and emotions. After a student activist, Abu Sayeed, was killed in Rangpur during the quota movement, a mural appeared with the words, &quot;Who will bring justice for the murder of martyr Abu Sayeed?&quot; Although it was removed the next day, it inspired many.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nUndoubtedly, graffiti became a strong way to protest during the anti-discrimination movement. It was used to fight against the dictatorial government, which ruled for over 15 years. The movement began when students demanded changes to the quota system in government jobs. As the protests grew, graffiti became a strong weapon for the students. Walls in cities were filled with colorful pictures and writings. These artworks showed anger, hope, and unity. They carried strong messages against injustice, corruption and oppression. Some famous slogans were &quot;Quota Na Medha?&quot; and &quot;Bullet Diye Biplob Thame Na.&quot; The graffiti helped to give a voice to those who were silenced by the regime.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe protests became stronger after students at Dhaka University were attacked by government forces. Graffiti was a way to show their anger and demand change. Students and others painted murals in Dhaka and other cities. These murals became symbols of resistance. It turned every wall into a canvas for their defiance. The artwork also created solidarity among various groups who were victim of social and economic division.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAfter falling down the govt. on 5 August 2024, graffiti spread across the country. Students painted walls to honor martyrs and support the revolution. Symbols like clenched fists and the rising sun were common. Even rickshaw pullers and artists joined in it. They donated money and effort. The once-silenced voices now echoed through the streets. The power of visual expression solidified the movements legacy.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nGraffiti became the voice of the July Revolution of 2024. It reminded people of their power to fight against injustice and create change. This art continues to inspire freedom and strength in Bangladesh.",

They are summer, rainy, autumn, late autumn, winter and spring. Every season has its unique features. Of all these seasons I like the spring most. This season consists of the Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra. It is the best, the loveliest and the most charming of all the seasons. It is called the king of all seasons. It is the last of six seasons in Bangladesh. There are some specific reasons why I like the spring most.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nTo me, the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings to the people. The autumn and the late autumn have also more or less disadvantages like the summer, rainy and winter seasons. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWith the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. The spring season gives a fresh start and new lives to the trees which shed their leaves in winter. Everything in the nature looks fresh. The sky looks clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves. The flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard everywhere. The melodious songs of the cuckoo sooth our mind. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People also enjoy a better health. Besides, during this time, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available in our country.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe season has a few disadvantages, too. During this season, some people suffer from diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox, etc.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIn spite of its few disadvantages, its positive aspects are overwhelming. The convenience it offers fascinates all. Thats why, I like the spring season most.",

Only combined efforts can resolve this problem.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe government alone cannot solve this problem. Educated people of the society must play an important role in this respect.

Obscene and immoral films, dramas or music videos are influencing young generation. Indeed, violent films are often making young people aggressive and quarrelsome. These are the reasons of moral degradation and tremendous increase of social crime in our country.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nTherefore, the government should put some restrictions on the telecast of the satellite TV channels. Guardians should encourage their children to watch the channels which telecast educational programmes. We must motivate our youths to take the good things from satellite TV channels and avoid the bad things. Family and educational institutions can play a major role in this regard.",

Moreover, it is safe and interesting.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nDuring the last winter vacation, I along with my parents made a journey by train from Dhaka to Chattogram to attend the wedding ceremony of my cousin.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWe reached the station about half an hour before the departure of our train and bought tickets. The station offered a scene of great activities. Rickshaws, motor cars, etc. were coming to the station with passengers. Coolies were running behind them. There was a long queue before the ticket counter.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nI managed to take my seat beside the window to enjoy the natural sights. At 7 a.m., the guard blew the whistle and the train started moving towards the destination and our journey began. The train first moved slowly, then it geared up quickly. Fresh wind began to enter the compartment. I began to enjoy beautiful sights. Every sight impressed me. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. In the train, it seemed to me that we were not moving but the trees, houses and other things outside the train were moving backwards speedily. In fact, the train was moving but they were still. I was charmed by this. Some were gossiping, some were sleeping in the compartment. Hawkers were selling their goods shouting their unique voice.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nWe enjoyed gossiping with our fellow travellers. Our train touched at few big stations and we bought boiled eggs, bananas and green coconuts and also some magazines. When we were in Chattogram, we saw many hills which gave me much delight.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nAt last, the train reached Chattogram Railway Station at 1.00 p.m. We got down from the train and saw my cousin waiting at the station. He had come to receive us. He became very pleased to see us.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe journey by train gave me much pleasure and experience. I wish I could make it again. Its memory will last in my mind as long as I live.",

Heavy monsoon rain began to fall around mid-August and then continued pouring for days. This caused the water level of the rivers to rise and overflow. The situation worsened when India released water from the dams in Tripura. It triggered the floodwaters to increase dangerously. The floods affected 11 districts in north-eastern and south-eastern Bangladesh, including Noakhali, Cumilla, Lakshmipur and Chattogram. A total of 73 upazilas and 528 unions were severely impacted.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe rising water damaged homes, roads, schools, and farms. It affected more than 5.8 million people all over the country. People had to leave their homes seeking safety. Many of them took shelter in evacuation shelters. On the other hand, many had to leave the city and move in with their relatives. Still, a great number of people remained trapped in their houses in the affected areas, waiting to be rescued. For many consecutive days, there was also no electricity, gas or mobile network. People started running out of their rations and safe drinking water.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe floodwaters also ruined agricultural fields, fishponds and livestock, causing millions of dollars in damage. A significant amount of crops were destroyed. It make the life harder for farmers. Contaminated water led to a serious health crisis as well, with a concerning outbreak of waterborne diseases.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nA few days later, India released even more water from the Farakka Barrage. It worsened the situation in districts like Noakhali and Feni. By the end of August, the rain stopped and the floodwater slowly began to go down. However, it took time for everything to return to normal.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nDuring this crisis, the government, army, navy, Fire Service, students, and various organizations like the As-Sunnah Foundation worked hard to help the flood victims. Many NGOs and volunteers provided food, clean water and medical help. Foreign countries also offered support. Citizens across Bangladesh supported relief efforts by donating money, clothes, dry food, medicine and other necessary items to help the flood victims. Despite the hardships, the people of Bangladesh showed strength and unity. They helped each other rebuilding their lives.",

Increase of temperature and natural disasters are the result of climate change. Due to increasing concentrations of Greenhouse Gases, our climate is expected to change even more in the coming decades. Our country is one of the most affected ones by climate change in the world.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThis climate change has a huge impact on our agriculture, infrastructure and way of life. This is mainly because\u003Cbr /\u003E\nof the geographical location of our country, making it highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Bangladesh has a flat, low lying landscape and lack of institutional setup. Climate change is becoming a crucial issue to us and to our government as well. More than 80% of the land is prone to flooding. About two-thirds of our population is engaged in agriculture. So climate change will affect the farmers immensely. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says, Bangladesh would experience a net increase in poverty of 15% by 2030 due to climate change. 17% people of the country will need to be relocated if global warming persists at the present rate. 81% migrants in Dhaka&#39;s slums reported a climate-related issue for displacement. It has been predicted that there will be 3 to 10 million internal migrants in Bangladesh over the next 40 years. According to the World Bank, climate change will cost Bangladesh USD 121 billion during 2005-2050, or USD 3 billion annually, unless measures are taken.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThis natural disaster brings floods, cyclones, storms, extreme temperature and drought into the country. Mostly, the northern regions of Bangladesh suffer due to extreme temperature problem.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe World Bank warns Bangladesh of becoming the country worst hit by climate change by the year 2100. A WB report estimates that the sea level will rise by 3 feet. This will cause huge flooding and the failing of crops in the country. This will cause poverty and inflation.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nSo, it can be said that we are already paying the price of climate change. If we dont build consciousness and become aware, we will be in great danger in the near future.",

Trees are our best friend. We depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen which is very essential for our existence. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for some quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nFirst, it is important to know what trees do for us. Man needs oxygen. In every breath we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus, they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food, clothes, shelter, medicine and shades. We cannot live without the help of trees.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nBut, at present, people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting down them mainly for firewood and furniture. Everyday our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nTropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. Unfortunately, at present, they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, &#39;Greenhouse Effect&#39; has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Ice is melting in the South and North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. We should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop cutting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable.",
